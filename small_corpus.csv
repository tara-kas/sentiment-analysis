  The game costs $60 and it has almost no content. When the game first came out they said that they would add new content every so often in updates and that was true. They did add new content but the content they added was just weapons. NOT EVEN NEW WEAPONS, the weapons they added are just clones of the first few weapons but with tiny stat changes and a new name on the front like, ""custom"" or ""deco"" but in reality it is just the same weapon. They have added new maps to play on in the update, but you can't only play 2 different maps for 3 hours before they change them, this makes the game get boring very fast. The game does have a one player story mode but after the first few levels all of the levels after them were basically the same. There weren't that many levels and they all took me about 1 minute to complete.

  Turf wars are a fun mode where 4 players compete against 4 other players to see who can cover the ground with the most ink. You start out at level 1 and you usually play with people up to level 10 or less. Once you hit level 4 your released from your protection, you start playing with people up to level 50. There is pretty much nobody who is around your level and most people you play with are between level 40 and 50. You are still limited to what guns and gear you can have so you end up being ambushed and killed by level 50's looking for an easy kill. It's like players that are level 50 have run all the newcomers out. There is another option you can play ranked battle where you only play people that are your rank. The downside is that when you lose the match you lose points. If you lose a certain amount a points your rank goes down. That it fair to me, but even if you get a connection error that has nothing to do with your internet you still lose points towards your rank.

  The connection errors are frequent and very annoying. Every time there is an error it blames you for your internet connections and then will not let you join another battle. I noticed that the connection errors usually happen with 5-10 seconds left in the match when you are about to get you reward. If you are in ranked battles when this happen you automatically lose points. At first I thought it really was my internet but then quickly realized that my other games that use internet work just fine without problems. When ever there is a connection error I have to turn my system off and on again and wait for the game to load.

Those are my 3 main dislike but there are many more detail I believe should be fixed. I recommend only buying this game if it is on sale for less than $40.",$20 game in disguise,1455753600,4,"{'Edition:': ' Game', 'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii U'}",

Most of you are probably familiar with Steam.  You can only activate the game you bought through Steam.  But what if Steam is not working as it should?

That is what my situation is now.  Steam will not accept my activation login and password due to system error.  There is no phone number to call in order to fix this.  The only ting that you can do is contact them by e-mail and it takes them about a week for them to get back to you.  In my situation they have sent me responses telling me that the problem is fixed when it really isn't.  So I e-mail them back and I wait another week to get the same result.

The only change that has taken place in this process over the last two months is that someone from Steam sent me an e-mail telling me that I need to log into my account and then change my password.

Well how can I do that of I can't log into my account in the first place? Duh!

(---) It's absolutely bug infested, riddled with quest and progress breaking bugs. I have had to re-log in order to force portions of quests to function approximately 20% of the time. Game breaking bugs made the first dungeon incapable of being finished. I have fallen through the world and been unable to play again until after the servers were taken down for maintenance. Several other times I fell through the world, was forced to re-log, then had to wait 10-15 minutes before I could control my character again. I've lost levels to random ""rollbacks"" - in which the client experiences an error and crashes, and when you log back on you've lost your past hour of progress. I've been killed instantly by terrain, become trapped in rocks or walls or grass, been shot into the sky by passing NPCs......this is disgraceful. I have beta tested many games, played many MMOs at launch, and never, ever, have I seen a game so incredibly unfinished. I am not being hyperbolic at all when I state that this game is still in alpha, and it is a shame that Bethesda is charging money for it

(-) Controller support is absent, and the general keyboard & mouse controls are awkward. It plays very similar to Skyrim but with subtle differences to accommodate for the fact that it's a MMO. Sadly these subtle differences don't translate well.

(+/-) Presentation is generally strong, but suffers from some incredibly low res textures throughout, alongside some awful voice acting and animation. Most of it is good, but the poor parts are truly terrible and jarring

(+) A huge world full of memorable content, on and off the beaten path. It makes Skyrim seem downright tiny in comparison

(+/-) Deep and layered character customization (regarding skills, not aesthetics) that translates pretty well to combat and general gameplay, offset by the awkward controls and some pre-beta level tuning

(-) User interface, crafting, inventory, it's all a mixed bag of poor, dated design elements and mechanisms. It is so awful it deserves its own bullet point. The basic bag and banking systems, common to MMOs and refined over the years, is like something out of a nightmare in 2003

(-) Stability is abysmal. Lag is common. Interactions not working. Group members appearing offline when they're in front of you. Guild functions not working for days. Dropped packets. Etc, etc, etc. It's like some tiny fly-by-night company is running this thing. It's sad

(-) Aggressively drab and uninspired character and gear design. This applies to not just gear, like armor and weapons, but also spells and abilities and class distinctions. I don't expect the players in an Elder Scroll game to resemble blinking neon signs like they do in other games (WoW), but man, even the best gear one could acquire in this game is just plain and boring.

I was extremely excited for it and was hoping it would be DICE quality like battlefield 3 or 4. Unfortunately, it was Dice quality like Battlefield Hardline...and even worse if that's believable. They began making vehicles (air and ground) unbearable to drive/fly starting with Hardline..now it's worse in Battlefront.

It seems like video games (FPS games in particular) are heading to the crappy direction of this:

Release game that's 1/4th of the way done...skip out on the campaign, make the most money. while were at it; let's add season passes and DLC's that all should be a part of the game when it was released anyways, but we want to nickel and dime our customers so we make money and this games longevity, as far as value to us, last three times as long.

The only way this will stop is if people stop buying garbage games like this. But, as these big companies know too well, that will never happen. They know that they can get away with this and people will still continue to buy them.

PROS:

* The graphics on this game are top notch. They really are beautiful. But, that's about the extent of the goodness of this game.
* Gameplay is fairly fluid, guns shoot like crap but that just takes practice.

CONS:

* Flying in vehicles is near impossible. I'm assuming whoever was in charge of the controls for that were drunk...although i have seen like 3 people be successful in it.
* Having and keeping a partner in this game is ridiculous. It always screws up and makes me lose my partner while he's still able to use me as a partner, and vise versa. They really went half @## on this game.
* There's not really any ground vehicles..which is annoying.
* The fact that there's no space flying at all is pretty disappointing.
* I feel like the power ups and hero pickups should be something earned via killstreak or something other than a random pickup. If you've played this game at all, you'll realize how over powered Boba Fett is. if you get Boba Fett; you're pretty much guaranteed to go about 50 kills without dying.
* Having No campaign is a pretty big flaw..but that was expected..and it's becoming the norm for big companies who produce multi player games.
* The load out capabilities and weapon options are pretty limited....but of course, they'll sell that as part of a DLC! Go figure.

So yeah, I highly recommend you read the bad reviews here, watch youtube reviews, and do some research before you consider buying this game. It really is THAT bad. One of the worst games to be released in a very long time. As a Battlefield fan, I'm dreading what will come out in the next Battlefield installment if this is a sign of what's to come as far as effort in making a good game.

Even with the price cut, this collection is a blatant slap in the face to gamers.  The sound quality in all three games is atrocious, to the point of making the games completely unplayable.

The sound fxs are WAY too loud: scampering bugs and cries drill into your skull with a series of repetitive onslaughts.  The music is WAY too soft: unless the other tracks are turned completely down it is inaudible.  Lastly, the volume of speech differs between in-game cinematics and cut-scenes.  Therefore, it is either blaring or completely underwhelming.

I've encountered less than perfect sound mixes in the Tomb Raider Trilogy (HD collection) and Call of Duty: Black Ops; however, I was able to adjust the sound levels within those games and find an acceptable balance.  The mixing in the Prince of Persia Trilogy is not the worst issue.  The REAL PROBLEM is the quality of the audio.

EVERYTHING sounds like it is being broadcast through a tin can and then transmitted with reverb set to +11.  Effects are also frequently absent or out of place: explosions and rock slides may have no audio whatsoever, while a water fountain at the end of a hallway booms with the verocity of Niagra Falls. Between the abhorrent tonal qualities and discontinuous sounds the audio is beyond mere mediocrity. Not only that, dolby digital doesn't work properly and the sound needs to be set to 2 channels.

I have many HD collections: Metal Gear Solid, God of War, God of War: Origins, Jak & Daxter, Tomb Raider Trilogy, and Ico & Shadow of the Colossus.  When I purchase an HD collection, I EXPECT the same sort of HD treatment.

Graphically the HD 16:9 looks on par with other collections.  The menu system is terrible though, and will not let you choose from other games without quitting to the PS3 home menu.  They also forgot to add sound effects for choosing between the 3 games or options.

All in all, this is a LAZY, AWFUL port that should NOT have made it through Quality Assurance.  As a big fan of the Assassin's Creed series, I expected more from Ubisoft.  I've eagerly anticipated playing these games for a long time, but playing through them with this sound quality is absolute torture.

The Prince of Persia Trilogy is the worst port, or ""upgrade"" release I have ever purchased.  If Ubisoft had any respect for its fans it would patch the issues or recall the original versions.  If this was a film release of a classic, people would be in an uproar!

For newcomers, the sound is an immediate disconnect from the series.  For longtime fans, this release is the equivalent of gaming blasphemy.

However the response to what you do is very good.  It reacts almost instantly to what you do and it almost always does it the way you intended.  Also, it almost never swings when you did not intend to -- and when you swing it almost always swings too.  Plus the kind of stroke you use is represented accurately. For example when you use a forehand it does a forehand etc.  In this game you can play singles but the responsiveness of the racket is poor in comparison to the responsiveness of the Wii Sport Tennis game.  For example, most of the time it represents a backhand accurately, but occasionally it doesn't -- this happens much more frequently than it does in Wii Sport tennis.  It seems to have more trouble with forehands.  Sometimes I swing and it doesn't swing -- this occurs much more frequently than it does in Wii Sport Tennis.  Sometimes I don't swing and it swings -- again, this occurs much more frequently than in Wii Sport Tennis.  Plus in Wii Sport tennis the response to what you do is almost instant.  In this game you often see it respond somewhat after you do your stroke and in a way that the programming of the character switches around after you do it.  They need to improve the programming on this game  a lot.  I hope future versions are better than this one.  Some of the reviews said they spent long hours getting used to this before they liked it.  You can get used to lots of poorly done things if you spend long hours using them -- but that doesn't make up for the fact that it was poorly done in the first place.

We've purchased every CoD game since 07/08ish.  I am not a big time gamer.  I'm not an excellent CoD player, but I am OK.  8/10 games on previous games I'd go positive.  I would say I was somewhat confident in my game play skills going into Black Ops 3.  Normally after a few games and figuring out the maps I'm decent, if not good.  I figured it'd be the same way with BO3... WRONG.  SO WRONG.  This game is horrific.

MP: I'm lucky if I get more than three kills and die less than 25 times.  I don't feel like it's always me as a player either.  I'll clearly be shooting someone and I get no hit markers.  I'll come up behind someone and start shooting and they magically have the ability to turn around, shoot, and kill me.. all the while I am shooting them.  I feel like I die ridiculously easy.  I know when I've been outskilled versus the game just hating me.  I am CONSTANTLY lagging.  Every game I'm bouncing from the full bars down to one bar.  Bouncing around everywhere.  It's awful.  Parties?  Ha, good luck.  I have a group of four people and we had no problems playing together in Advanced Warfare or Ghosts.  It's like winning the lottery if BO3 will let us all play together.  I thought it was maybe our internet that was causing all of these issues, so we decided to try Advanced Warfare again and test out whether it was us or BO3.  Definitely not us.  I rarely lag on AW and don't have an issue with parties.  At first I thought I just sucked and I was in denial, but reading the amazon reviews and some reddit posts I KNOW I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE!

Zombies: Would have been one of the only redeeming qualities except they seemed to some how F that up too.  To buy a gun off the wall you have to be looking at it in just the right way at exactly the right spot or it doesn't work.  In Zombies of the past you just had to be close to it, hell even slightly brush by it, and you had a new gun.  Extremely frustrating when you have a train of zombies following you and you can't easily purchase a gun.  Becoming the beast is an interesting aspect and makes it fun, but the human sacrifices, and gateworms and whatever the hell else you have to do just to upgrade your gun is kind of crazy.  Man, do I miss Kino Der Toten.

Campaign: I haven't a chance to play it and really haven't been as excited to this game because of all of the aforementioned issues.  I like that it's co-op though.  So, yay.  One gold star from me.",I feel like Treyarch robbed me...,1448755200,12,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I do, however, read reviews and I tend to watch game play trailers and the like, so I do research my purchases. I also think I am fairly easy to please. That said, its been a long time since I have disliked something this much, and so quickly.

The graphics are some of the worst I have ever seen, and I have everything cranked all the way up. Return to Castle Wolfenstien looked better than this.... years ago. Not only are the environments utterly boring, but they are rendered at a quality that is easily being surpassed by even the least graphic-intensive games of the last two or three years.

Graphics are not everything though, and were that my sole complaint, I'd not bother with a review.

There is apparently no such thing as enemy AI. Get in front of the completely random assortment of ""demons,"" most of which look like rubber toys with teeth, and _sometimes_, if they aren't too buy roaming aimlessly back and forth, they might attack. They can also apparently walk through any obstacle in their path should they choose to engage you, including buildings- and by walk through them, I mean ""as if they are not there"". Not that it matters. I played for a couple of hours and fought dozens and dozens of utterly random monsters and never came anywhere near getting killed.

The dialog is unbelievably juvenile and utterly silly, and the character animations during said dialog are about 2 seconds long, endlessly repetitious, and look like they were choreographed by a two year old. If there is a ""story"" to this game, I have yet to figure out what it is.

The quests, so far, are also ridiculous, extremely simple, and highly unimaginative. I have heard people complain about the ""fetch this, get that"" quests in other RPG style games like Oblivion, but this game is nowhere near the quality of Oblivion in any way whatsoever.

Seriously, I almost never post negative reviews, but this is ridiculous. Maybe I am missing something... perhaps if I was nostalgiac for Diablo I would get the joke, but as it stands, as a game on any level, I cannot find a single good thing to say about this title.

What everyone is complaining about is not far off at all and really does ruin the overall experience.  It took over 4 hours to get the game installed (one year old Macbook Pro) since STEAM, the flaming pile of !#@$ that it is, required five updates.  This was an active process, not me leaving the computer somewhere for four hours to let it update.  I had to sit there watching it because the updates would drop out as they were downloading and STEAM would say I wasn't connected to the internet.  I finally got everything updated (STEAM, mind you, not the game), updated the GAME for another 20 minutes, and started playing.  The game is Civilization-esque.  I guess they decided to make a bunch of changes so it wasn't just Civ 4.2.  The complaints about unit movement are spot on.  Frustrating pain in the @$$.  Defenseless units (catapult, cannon) will be easily overrun since there is no way to stack units and defend on all fronts.  City management seems to be lacking in some critical areas (why can't I sacrifice production to make citizens happy?  And why are they still unhappy when I've built EVERY building that should make them happy!?), but overall, the game still retains the Civilization feel.

The buttons are amazing, especially a b x and y- they're light as a feather, and feel more like a very high-end mouse click than a controller button.

The longer triggers and adjustable thumbsticks are GREAT for racing games, though I admit for fps games I just leave the triggers on the loosest setting.

The d pad is great for blops but worthless for just about anything else.

Now on to the part where it gets one star:

It lasted about 4 weeks before it started to fail.  The left thumbstick started ghosting (basically it registers upward movement when it's not being manipulated at all), the housing started to crack and creak jut from squeezing it to press in r3, and finally, the left trigger stopped sensing consistent presses before I threw in the towel.

I'm sending it back to razer, though I'm not really excited about my replacement. It's too bad too because ergonomically I'm not sure  much could be improved- its an awesome controller!. Sigh.

EDIT / UPDATE: Razer replaced the defective unit.  In fact, they screwed up and sent me TWO replacements.  WOO-HOO!  Right?  RIGHT???  Nope.  Wrong.  Both replacement units (brand-new in the box replacements, not refurbished units) broke within just a couple weeks of use.  Since they sent me multiple replacements (I had argued my way up to a supervisor after having my return order ignored for over SIX MONTHS, and both the supervisor and the person I originally dealt with accidentally sent me a replacement), I figured I would use them one at a time.  Basically, I thought: ""if the next one breaks, I'll still have a third, brand-new in the box, waiting as a replacement.""  Three units in, I figured I'd HAVE to get my money's worth.  Nope.  The first replacement lasted less than 2 weeks, which is less than ~10 hours of gameplay for me, before the left trigger started registering button presses like a strobe light (quite the trippy effect when trying to aim down the sights in an FPS game).  The second replacement admittedly lasted about 6 weeks, and then the thumbstick ghosting started up and the B button stopped working.

Activation UI should only come into play with digital downloads, where a separate application (EA common application??) is installed on your computer, in lieu of DRM, to authenticate the game.  Perhaps the EA web page is wrong, maybe this applies to all versions of DAI on PC.  In any case, the game cannot launch, because it can't get past the activation UI process.

On the EA help site, threads posted seems to indicate this problem has cropped up with the release of patch 6.

When this issue is resolved, I will update my review, to include game play, since I only got to the first boss (Pride Demon) before the game crashed.  After that, I've been locked out of the game.","So far, not so good.",1429315200,6,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

155021,1.0,False,"07 3, 2008",A3ESEJUNUQZU2I,B0013G0XZC,P R,"As a fan of playing tennis, I was very eager to try Top Spin 3. Since I use my Wii for exercise as well as entertainment, I like to play sports games -- especially tennis ones -- to get some activity. However, although I was initially looking forward very eagerly to Top Spin 3, I found that its execution was seriously lacking.

For one, there are only a handful of players even available, some of which aren't really all that intuitive to guess. I'm not a follower of professional tennis very closely, but even I could see that there are some glaring omissions. Also, there is no character creation, so the individual element is completely absent. They added a few original characters, but they somehow felt that they could not even include a rudimentary character creation mode? Sloppy.

What is most sloppy, however, and utterly disappointing is the game itself. No difficulty settings means that the unforgiving and often very bad control scheme has to be accustomed to on the fly. A pathetically inadequate tutorial does not excuse this fundamental omission. Furthermore, the controls themselves are as far from intuitive as possible; the controller is, for some reason, held sideways. The player's character moves on-screen in a stuttering mess that frequently prevents him from reaching an adequate point from which he may return the ball. The controls, which are supposed to mimic the player's own movements, rarely do this and are token at best. Typically you will try for a special shot exactly as the tutorial instructed, only to have it ignore your movements or misinterpret them.

That doesn't even begin to address the other fundamental problems it has, such as the fact that it doesn't feel like you actually control anything. Even the pop-up help instructs you to time your swings to match the on-screen player. Why, then, are we instructed to swing at all, if the game itself tries to anticipate our swing and then make us match theirs?

I thought that Top Spin 3 would surely be more satisfying than Sega Superstars Tennis which, while a pretty good game, lacked in tournaments and was too harsh when it came to unlockables through them. There also wasn't that much responsiveness depending on specific motions by the player, which Top Spin 3 was supposed to address. Unfortunately, however, it didn't. Sega Superstars Tennis remains a vastly superior game, both in entertainment value and tennis authenticity, even with the super moves.

To boot, Sega Superstars Tennis also had three control schemes, which Top Spin 3 would have benefited from; the movement in Top Spin 3 is atrocious and unresponsive at the worst times. Having an option to handle it automatically would have been a great relief. However, they opted for the extremely awkward option of holding the Wii remote sideways, for no valid reason.

All in all, Top Spin 3 plays like an unfinished tech demo that should never have left the studio. It's a poor excuse for a tennis game, but moreover it's a poor excuse for a game overall. With horrible music, barely adequate sound effects (and an absolutely gratingly annoying umpire/judge voice that belches out his calls), and mediocre graphics, it looks like an unfinished PS2 game that they thought they could slap a full asking price on and sell.

This game isn't even worth bargain bin trips. Give it a miss and buy Sega Superstars Tennis instead, or wait for a more satisfying realistic tennis game. Top Spin 3 isn't it. In fact, it isn't much of anything at all.","A Shoddy Tech Demo, but Full-Priced",1215043200,7,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

Good graphics compared to many other RTS games I have played.

That all sounds fantastic, but don't lose sight of the short (but VERY SIGNIFICANT) list of CONS:
--------------------------

*Limited Installations mean you don't really 'own' the game, you're just renting it at full price. (if you're buying a retail copy, and not a copy from Steam)

*SecuROM (again, assuming you're getting retail and not Steam) This SecuROM stuff that RA3 will install on your computer before you're able to play is BAD NEWS.  Many people have had serious difficulties with their computers after SecuROM has infested them, and apparently it is not very easy to get rid of once it has infested your computer.

*The RA3 Tanya just wasn't as good as RA2 Tanya.  Kari Wuhrer did a much better job, and the actual Tanya UNIT is not as fun to play with either.  Tanya's range has been reduced to a point where enemy infantry (yes, even conscripts) can now shoot Tanya before she can shoot them.  Tanya is no longer the sort of ""hero"" unit that, with a small amount of support and a good deal of micromanagement can wipe out whole platoons of enemy infantry and bases with style.  This was a huge negative, as Tanya has played a very central role to the Red Alert universe for several of the Red Alert games now.  Going back to the Kari Wuhrer point though.. Kari was much more ""tough"" whereas the new Tanya is basically a cheerleader dressed up as Tanya, and she really just doesn't fit the role as well.

*Tanya's guns just aren't as good (or cool) as they used to be.  Looks like she's got some Desert Eagles now or something instead of the classic old .45 colts, and her range has been reduced to a point where she is basically neutered as a unit.  Not cool.  I don't even use her anymore to speak of because of this.

To sum things up, you'll probably enjoy the game, but it just lacked some essential things Red Alert 2 had.  However, I strongly, STRONGLY recommend you purchase the game on STEAM instead of in boxed retail form, since STEAM will not include any of the activation limits or SecuROM malware/trojans/spyware type of crap that will infest your computer if you install the retail version.

Where to begin?

Gameplay:

1. Overly easy: challenge free gameplay that makes Celda Wand Wacker Teletubby Island (some erroniously refer to this game as ""Zelda Wind Waker"") gameplay come off like Ninja Gaiden in comparison. Seriously you will NEVER die in this game, not even ONCE, not even if you are a lobotomy patient!

2. Items: No need to possess any actual skill, just go around and hack up some bushes (Eiji Aonuma's favorite gameplay element from LTTP incidentally) and collect enough rupees and you can buy everything that you used to have to search for (in the superior Pre-Aonuma Zelda's ie Zelda 1-4) in order to find. Just pay that stupid Ravio creature for it and you'll get everything from the hookshot to the boomerang with no risk at all to your character's health.

3. Lame gimmick: which turns you into a wall painting, the true purpose of which is not to expand the gameplay elements of the Zelda series in any meaningful way but just another arrogant and obnoxious attempt by Eiji Aonuma to force his disgusting and deformed art style version of Link down our collective throats. The guy simply will not learn his lesson that the Zelda fanbase utterly rejects his chibi art style as well the Saturday morning cartoon presentation for Zelda. In the year 2013 we demand realism NOT sub par dumbed down graphics that appeal to the soccer mom and kintergarten set. We especially desire beautiful epic graphics and sophisticated art styles because we are paying for these expensive overpriced game machines to play these type of games on and we want to see some actual visual performance for our money. In anycase Aonuma doesn't just need to be fired by Nintendo, Nintendo should of never hired him to begin with.

4. Recharge bar: for all the Nintendo fanboy whining about the dominance of the ""dudebro"" first person shooter (FPS) games dominating the world of videogames these days and arguably dumbing it down as a result Eiji Aonuma has ripped off this feature from the Halo series but instead of providing a shield for Link Aonuma has used HIS recharge bar newly added gameplay element to make the game even easier than it already was since now you no longer have to find magic vials or arrows while adventuring out in the world the bar just recharges automatically after you shoot some arrows or use an item such as say the lantern. Seriously Aonuma will not be satisfied until Nintendo allows him to add a dedicated ""win button"" to Zelda.

-Continued pushing of Nintendo's politically correct LGBT agenda by featuring a decidedly homosexual character in a Bunny rabbit suit named Ravio. Ravio is a human character dressed in a bunny suit that helps your character Link throughout the game by offering him various ""tools"" (note the subconscious innuendo there)...Anyway I believe the proper term for this sort of sexual fetish means of dress up role play is called being a ""furry"" if I'm not mistaken? Whatever the case its incredibly sick and inappropriate for children to be exposed to a freak like Ravio in this sort of ""E for everyone"" style game. I'm quite certain Nintendo's featuring of this sick and unsavory degenerate character of Ravio is along the same lines as how the tobacco companies used to use the Joe camel character to push young children into smoking. Well Nintendo obviously wants to encourage young people to become homosexuals which doesn't make any sense since the left generally says such people are born and not made. In anycase creepy and inappropriate character design by Nintendo/Aonuma here and thats not a judgement of being anti gay or even anti furry it is simply a desire for cohesiveness and congruency ie a movie about Martin Luther King Jr. would not be at all served in it's contexual believability by having a white man play the part of Dr. King, likewise homosexual characters and furry fetishists simply do not belong in the context of a midieval sword and sorcery action adventure which The Legend Of Zelda always was, up until the moment that is the untalented hack Eiji Aonuma got involved in it's development. Now much like with society Aonuma has destructively turned Zelda into an ""anything goes"" free for all where trains, robots, homosexuals, furries and other inappropriate set pieces are placed in a game world where they simply do not belong.

-Rehashing Zelda: A Link To the Past's overworld maps in order to try and trick the Zelda fanbase into believing that Zelda is returning to it's glorious form from the past, when really this game is just another Aonuma turd that would've been better off not being made at all.

What Zelda as a series and game franchise desperately needs is Yoshiaki Kozuimi or Takashi Tezuka in the director's chair for it ever as a series to return to health.

To conclude and re-state my own review title over again because its THAT important to say it twice...

Eiji Aonuma is a cancer on the Zelda series and must be excised for the Zelda series to ever become well again.

Nearly every review I've read says it's a ""masterpiece"". ""One of Rockstar's best games ever made""... etc. Maybe it was... This version on the 360 however, is completely BROKEN.

I'm not sure how anyone was able to play it. The camera flips in the opposite direction whenever being chased by anyone so you have no idea which direction you're running. Just navigating through this game is nearly impossible. It freaking maddening. After attempting the ""that bitch"" mission about 20 times (this is EARLY in the game), I just threw may hands in the air; took the game out of the console, put back into the case and chucked it into the ""sell"" pile. I'm done. Can't do it. Unplayable -- just broken and not my idea of ""fun"".

This was an older title from the ps2 ported over early on. The graphics and style of the game are seriously dated... but I was completely OK with that. I actually prefer some of the older single player titles with great gameplay. I would have probably loved this game if it had only WORKED.

And the funny thing is, I just finished another broken disaster of a game ""Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare"". Looks like Rockstar is getting a nice big pile of broken trash to add to their resume lately. After this one, I think I'm done with Rockstar and their broken trash titles altogether.

I preordered this game but then cancelled at the last second right before my order shipped. My friend got the collectors edition so he gave me the starter edition code. I created a starter edition account, and downloaded it. I didn't have any problems with the download, or logging into the game, however, I didn't even try until about 15 hours after game launch.

I read the Blizzard forums and saw all the bad reviews of the game... Kind of reminds you of all the World of Warcraft failures, doesn't it?

Well I didn't expect much better. WoW was such a great game, but once they fired all the original developers, the game went down hill fast. Diablo 3 follows in that path... All the hype, and media, and presales events, etc...

I was so excited... logged into the game for the first time, and oh... I can't customize my chracter at all.. Ok.. That sucks. We'll lets get into the game. When the game loaded, that instant, ""WOW!"" just... wasn't there.

I actually sat there starting at my character in disappointment for about 5 minuets before I even touched the mouse and tried to move him. Right off the bat, it just felt wrong. I can't get into my character, I can't customize him at all. The graphics are okay, but not as good as they proclaimed.

I played the game for about an hour, trying as hard as I could to give it a chance, and then decided I was going to go do homework instead... YES! HOMEWORK!!! Instead of playing Diablo 3.

Blizzard had a good run, and many great years with Warcraft, the original Diablo games and WoW, but it's just not there anymore. I have no interest in their games, and it's not just me. All my friends are also disappointed with the game.

We planned for months to try and be one of the first guilds on the game, bringing our WoW guild over, and leveling together. But after hours and hours of not being able to play and servers being down, most of them went to bed, and forgot about the game. Several months worth of hype and anticipation gone, in within a couple hours of looking at the broken login screen.

I've reinstalled Diablo 1 and Diablo 2, and I'm going to play those again, because those were great games. But Diablo 3, just fell short, way short. Honestly, it's Blizzard, I didn't expect any less from them. That name use to mean great games, now all it means to me is frusteration from server problems, failed releases, blown WOTLK and Cata xpacks, LFR looters that win multiple items and vendor the extras, and oh.. don't forget the automated macro responses you get if you ever email them for help.. What did they ever do with the nice game masters that use to work there?

I remember when I first started playing WoW.... I was so amazed, standing in Mulgore, looking around, and actually manging to get my character stuck (how you do that in Mulgore, it takes skill), and contacting a game master for help, who magically spwaned into the game, set me free and even showed me around Bloodhoof Villiage a little bit... how amazing that was... WAS.

Diablo 2 was such an amazing game... I feel lf I play this game... I won't feel the same about Diablo 2 anymore. All the hype from this game was because people were thinking back to the days when they played Diablo 1 and Diablo 2... Hoping Diablo 3 would bring back those same feelings years later, but like a highschool sweetheart, the love is still there, but the ""grown up"" version of the game... just isn't the same.",Play Diablo 2 instead,1337040000,16,{'Format:': ' Computer Game'},

First thing i noticed was that the wires got in the way a few times. More importantly was that the mouse was not very smooth or accurate. The movements were very jerky at times. When i say at times, i mean one second it jerks too much while other times i have to lift the mouse to move the cursor all the way to the other side of the screen.  Often times i just want to make a slight movement and the cursor jumps almost 1/4 of the screen. This makes targeting enemies far away very difficult and cumbersome.

There is *ONE* save slot, and it cannot be erase under any circumstances that don't void your warrenty on the 3DS (aka using a hacking device).  One.  The stated reason is that Capcom doesn't like the fact you could play the game, get bored, sell it to someone else, and then two people have played the game with Capcom only making money off of one of them.  They are actively trying to kill the used-game market to help line their pockets in what is already one of the biggest industries on the planet.

No.  No dice.  Its my game, and if I decide I want to pick it up a year or two from now and start over from scratch, that is my decision.  Once Capcom has my money for the cartridge, what happens to it after that is none of their business.

And before anyone tries to jump me for leaving a review for a product I didn't buy, or for not reviewing the game itself, I would like to point out that this is not IGN.  It is not Gamespot.  It is Amazon, and we are reviewing the product being sold as a whole, and the DRM on this game is part of the product.  I don't need to buy the game to know that this is an industry damaging event, and to believe that Capcom *NEEDS* to be punished for this in the form of this game failing miserably in the sales department.

I have personally boycotted Capcom on the 3DS until there is an official apology for this.  I bought Street Fighter, and thats the last dime they'll get out of me.",If you thought Spore's DRM was bad...,1309219200,26,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Now, the question is why? I've played Star Wars Galaxies since launch. It was a fun game. It was one of the best games I've played. There were relatively few bugs, there were quests, and there was an extensive profession system.

There was. Star Wars Galaxies no longer exists. They screwed over their customers after 2 years of gameplay. Expansions were just a means of getting more money before altering the game entirely. You can no longer switch professions, and there are only 9 professions. Jedis are now available to everyone, and they are terrible.

I could continue on, but it only goes downhill from there. Do not buy this game. They just want your money.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you want to see what this game is really like now, you need to read the reviews in the Star Wars Galaxies: Starter Kit and ignore the earlier ones here. A lot of these reviews are old, and that is a BIG difference. Had I written this review before October/November, I would have given it praise. If I wrote it before June, possibly 4 or 5 stars.

10771,1.0,False,"12 24, 2001",ADJXL0W0RJ7VV,B000034DBS,Lord Chimp,"Strange how some people regard Grandia as the best Saturn RPG and one of the best on the PlayStation. While Grandia possesses some interesting qualities, it is completely dismantled by a series of devastating flaws that cripple the game. This review will be formulaic, but it will get the point across.

The graphical engine was very good. 2D characters and 3D environments that can be rotated at will. I like nuances, and Grandia possesses many. I like knocking over teapots and making clotheslines as I walk into them. The spell effects were boring, however, and the FMV, while technically good at the time, just wasn't exciting.

The music is overwrought and almost silly. The main themes seem bombastic and pretentious, as if the game is saying, ""Come look at me, I'm important!"" The compositions are impressive musically, but they feel emotionally hollow. There is one song, a piano & violin duet, which I loved. It was completely gorgeous. I also liked how the combat music changed as the game continued. RPGs often frustrate me by giving me the same combat music through the entire 40 hour game.

In Grandia, using specific kinds of magic or weapons makes you more skilled in that capacity. Naive gamers have said that Grandia's character growth system is innovative and interesting. It is not innovative, in my mind, and not interesting. Such systems have been done in 8-bit Final Fantasy games and reams of Japanese RPG with lower profiles (the SaGa games come to mind). Also, because the game is so long, you'll probably learn every spell and weapon technique about 50% though the game. Since this removes any real incentive to engage in combat, all future battles are suffocating in how boring they are.
The combat is boring. This is mainly because it is incredibly easy. I didn't spend extra time advancing my characters (I tried to finish the game ASAP, actually), so I definitely wasn't too strong. Still, not a single boss offered any form of challenge. Even the final boss felt like nothing more than a ponderous standard encounter. It seems evident to me that a game cannot be exciting when there is no threat...no sense of danger or challenge. This wouldn't be _that_ bad if the battles didn't take so long. So, you get thousands of long, boring, simple fights over the course of the game. The dungeons are amateur in design, and made about 10 times more dreadful because of the combat. There's also a gauge in combat that shows when when each character will take an action. However, this does not create any real strategy because all the characters move at different speeds, so it's just a funky gimmick.

The story is not bad, but it is badly told. It uses about every hackneyed Japanese RPG element imaginable, but it doesn't remedy this problem with interesting characters or compelling twists. The translation is just dumb. Sony broke it down to simple diction and pure, fatuous juvenalia. The ""romantic"" relationship between Justin and Feena is basically insulting -- it has the maturity of an elementary school infatuation. Sue is an utterly pointless character, who's involvement in the story is simple arbitrary and ridiculous. What is the creature ""Puffy""? The game never explains. I expected some kind of enigmatic quality to the creature, with a revelation disclosing all at some point (like Nall in Lunar). This never happens. It's stupid. The voice acting is hideous. Attemps at humor fall flat. Attempts at emotional expression are cringe-inducing.

The game took me about 50 hours to beat (though I tend to be slower than some). In my mind, the game is about 35 hours too long. So, expect the ""meat"" of the story to be padded with superfluous side-quests packed with obnoxious combat and torturous dialogue. I like side-quests...when they are optional or purposeful. In this game, the side-quests are neither. Adventures in a ghost ship or on a mysterious prehistoric valley might sound fun on paper, but without important story revelations or fun gameplay, it's boring. Granted about 10 hours of the game is pretty interesting. But that's a mere 20% of the game. In school, that would be an 'F'...a FAILING grade.

The game is just tedious. It's boring and insipid and hackneyed to death. I'm sure there will be many who say, ""Grandia rulez! you lie!"" and give me a ""not helpful"" vote. I didn't write this to please anybody...I wrote it because I think Grandia does not deserve the praise it receives. Heed my word, and perhaps you will save 50 hours of you life.

(EDIT: The wording on this did not make sense I changed it.)

If you did not like Battlefield: Bad Company 2 or Battlefield 3 this game is no different. Just a Graphical update and some new maps.

With that said I am running the Game on Ultra, and though in screen shots the difference between BF3 and BF4 looks awesome.. In the actual game I often forget I am playing BF4. The graphics simply do not look any different when in the midst of battle.  Black Ops 2 Still looks MUCH better in most areas of game play. BF3 and BF 4 do look better when you are looking out at a vista. But that is a matter of opinion.

As of this review the game is 100% not noob friendly. Everyone in the game after 10 hours of multi-player is a crack shot and will snipe you from all over the map on all of the maps. In fact I have not played a single game in the past 24 hours where each team was not apparently 80% snipers.

Spawn camping (getting killed the moment the level loads) Is extremely bad in the game. A few maps are worse than others, but for the most part every single map design allows for you to be shpot in the head before you are even done loading into the game.

Also my experiences with Amazon Customer Service and Origin Customer Service have been less than ideal. I have been trying to trurn the game with multiple calls to amazon and Origin and neither will budge. I understand that it is not the norm to allow the return of games, but that needs to change. I will probably be making my next game purchase (CoD:Ghosts?) From Gamestop simply due to their very generous return policy.

1. After the first game, the questions started repeating. The game is basically the same 40 questions over and over again.
2. You can't skip the introduction. I know it's not too long, but you'd think that with today's technology there'd be an option to skip it.
3. Regis is appallingly rude. Once I won nothing and he said, ""Welll, there you go. Don't spend it all in one place. In fact, don't spend it at all. Put it in the bank! In 40 years, maybe you'll be able to afford a marble or something!""
4. Once a $200 question appeared later as a $32,000 question. Um, that's not good.
5. The questions from $100 to $1,000 are too difficult (compared to the show). For example, the show had a $1,000 question that was ""How many legs does a spider have?"" But the game had a $1,000 question that was ""What kind of object is a 'ginsu'?""
6. Once again, Regis is appallingly rude. Once I won $1,000 and he said, ""Not bad, But at least you should've known the last one. Come on! Or at least you should've GUESSED better!""
7. Regis only says ""Is that your final answer?"" whenever he wants to. Most of the time, your first answer IS your final answer, even if you happened to hit the wrong button by mistake.
8. There's a ridiculous time limit of 30 seconds per question. I've seen people on the show take as long as 17 minutes.
9. The Fastest Finger mode is a joke. You're supposed to hit a letter key when you think the four answers are in the correct sequence. You don't actually put them in order.
10. Regis is appallingly impatient. If you take too long on certain things (like the Fastest Finger mode, or saying how many contestants will play), he'll say, ""This game is over! I'm outta here!"", and the game quits on you. Yep, you're back to Windows! And guess what? Once you load it back up again.....
11. ......you'll have to sit through the introduction again!

THIS GAME HAS THE ABSOLUTE WORST, WORST, W-O-R-S-T CONTROLS OF ANY VIDEO GAME THAT HAS EVER EXISTED.

I realize that I am kinda late to the party, critizing a now 5-year-old video game, but since Sonic Team's latest output with the truly awful Sonic the Hedgehog 4 was also aggravating and very poorly done I have to question what kind of work ethic is going on at Sega HQ. The programmers of this game should be blacklisted and banned from working in the industry forever. I'm not kidding. I'll get back to this after I detail the plot.

Doctor Eggman once again uses the power of the Chaos Emeralds to unleash a new nemesis in the form of Dark Gaia (nothing you haven't seen before in the previous Sonic Adventure games) which also smashes the planet apart. Instead of perishing in the vacuum of space the separate segments of the world remain intact, creating themed levels. With the Chaos Emeralds drained Sonic becomes a Werehog at night, giving the game split personality feel with one half being the high-speed 'thrills' that you 'love' and the other being a role-playing brawler. It doesn't really work so well, but I could have tolerated it if it were not for the very, very, incredibly looooong list of crippling flaws that absolutely destroy the game. I do not exaggerate folks, these are not merely superficial flaws. These are glitches that murder Sonic Unleashed right down to the marrow.

As you are probably already aware, the camera system for Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2 was epileptic and staggeringly disorientating. Compared to THIS game it might as well be the calm and measured cinematography of David Lean. The controls are a joke. Normally I'd say something along the lines of you only need luck, not skill or timing to finish some levels, but it just won't do for a game this terrible. A skinned, castrated, vivisected monkey with it's tongue nailed to the floor manipulating the controller with two forks sticking out of its eyeballs has every chance of finishing this game as you do. Make no mistake, the designers of this game better hope and pray that they never meet me, I just might be walking away from that situation in handcuffs. The level design is so poor, sadistic, badly-planned, and so utterly, utterly tedious I actually doubt that anyone at Sega played the game during the testing process.

How can a game this bad get produced and released? How? What is going on at Sega? You'd NEVER get Nintendo treating Mario this way. It truly boggles my mind that a major player in the video game industry can publish such utter garbage, and not only that, but starring their world-famous mascot too.

Do not buy this game. Do not rent or borrow this game. Do not go near it. Do not enter shops with this trash sitting on the shelves. There are not enough words in the universe to fully describe how breathtakingly awful Sonic Unleashed is. I fully intended to stick with it to finish story mode, but I can't put my sanity in that much jeopardy.

139212,1.0,False,"05 16, 2012",AFEQ9MCMMWD9E,B00178630A,Sunan Peebles,"I played D1 and D2 quite a bit. For a time, I played on Battle.net, and eventually collected some good items and had a fairly strong onlne character, but eventually I hated it (thanks to Blizzard's management and policies which did not allow you to host a non-P2P online game, and server lags from time to time). I loved playing D2 and LOD on my LAN though. No issues with hacking, because I and my group could control everything. I was foolish enough to buy and install D3 without realizing that there would be no LAN play, and no offline single player. So again, in D3 Blizzard made another major decision restricting players' freedom: internet only.

With D2, I had no problems with hacking or server lag, because I abandoned Battle.net. From my point of view, D3 is like the result of a doctor transplanting hemorrhoids to a healthy patient.

Let's review some of the arguments posted on this forum:

1) ""Things will be better after Blizzard resolves the server problems, and eventually there will be fewer users at any given time.""

For those who like online play and can accept off-and-on laggy servers or down servers at the worst possible moment, that is probably true. And Amazon ratings for D3 may go up. It is not true for me, because I have no desire to play on Battle.net. D3 will be a 1 star product from my point of view forever.

2) ""You should have known.""

That is true, but remember that many of us had been playing D2 for 12 years, and we were used to the freedom of being able to play offline. We did not imagine that Blizzard would remove that freedom in D3.

Imagine that you have been driving a certain brand of car for many years. This brand has built in ONSTAR and GPS, but up to now you could operate the car without being connected to those services. You go in and buy the latest model. The sales agent says that you have to have ONSTAR/GPS connected, but it's free. That's kind of strange, but you buy it anyway. Then you realize that you can't even drive the car without being connected. I realize that allowing a car to be returned is very different from allowing opened software to be returned, but I want Blizzard to realize that some of us will not trust them in the future. I will not ever buy from Blizzard again.

3) ""We can all blame the pirates.""

Let's see if I've got this straight. Blizzard could not control the hacking on battle.net, and so the solution is to force everyone onto battle.net, where the same hackers could attack the servers I am forced to use, and possibly attack the ports on my network that battle.net uses.

4) ""You are not rating the game, you are rating battle.net.""

The game IS battle.net now.

5) ""You clicked on the AGREE button when you installed it.""

If I had not agreed to the terms, I could not learn what it's like to play, and then you would say I don't know what I am talking about. Catch-22.

6) ""Online is the trend. It is inevitable.""

One of my biggest pet peeves is people writing video game reviews on Amazon when they haven't really played the game. Well, that's exactly what this review is going to be; and there is a very - very good reason I didn't play much of this game.

I love Sonic the Hedgehog, and if you read any of my other reviews you'll know that I also loved the Wii version of this game. The racing stages were amazing but unfortunately the Werehog wore thin too quickly and took up too much of the game. When I finally got a chance to play this for the 360 I was SO excited to see how the racing stages compared to the Wii! Would they be better? Would they be worse? The answer is...what racing stages?

In the two hours that my brother and I played this game we didn't get to one new racing stage. The only one we played was the one in the demo that we've played over and over again. Our time with Sonic Unleashed for the 360 was spent playing pointless quick time button mashing games in a plane that we didn't get to fly, and the rest was fighting a lot of bad controls, bad camera angles, bad and boring combat, awful level design and repetitive enemies in the Werehog sections.

In the Wii version the Werehog was only pointless. It could be fun at times but for the most part it was just a tacked on detour from what you really want to do in a Sonic game. It was inane, but it wasn't that much of a problem. Here, it's that much of a problem.

In the 360 version the Werehog is downright unplayable. The control is unresponsive and the hit detection is non existent half the time. You'd think that the game would compensate for such bad game play, but it actually does everything it possibly can to make things even worse for you. You get almost no save points which means if you've just spent half an hour lumbering around trying to hit things and punching nothing but air only to FINALLY - MIRACULOUSLY - get to where you are suppose to go and die, you have to re-do everything you just did OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

And that's when this game got shipped back to the rental place, but not before something unfortunate happened: I almost broke my brothers controller. True story! I've played a lot of bad games, but I've never played one so frustrating that I lost control of my self and chucked someone else's property on the floor before realizing what I was doing. But I have now; THANKS Sonic Unleashed!

A lot of people will say this review is unfair as I didn't actually play the game. Maybe the racing stages made up for the bad Werehog part of this game. I wish I knew. All I can say is: don't blame me for not knowing. If the game makers wanted me to play the racing stages, they should have let me play the racing stages.

We must let Bungie know, in no uncertain terms, that it has done inestimable damage to everything around it. Those who claim otherwise do so only to justify their own contemptible conclusions. If we are powerless to make some changes here, it is because we have allowed Bungie to keep a close eye on those who look like they might think an unapproved thought. My vision that some day, people everywhere will say ""no"" to Bungie's irritating roorbacks is an inspiring dream. Unfortunately, reality always awakens me and reminds me that I've heard Bungie say that you and I are inferior to mindless lumpenproletariats. Was that just a slip of the lip or is Bungie secretly trying to render unspeakable and unthinkable whole categories of beliefs about power? The complete answer to that question is a long, sad story. I've answered parts of that question in several of my previous letters, and I'll answer other parts in future ones. For now, I'll just say that it has been said that those who think that it has the trappings of deity should think again.

I thought since it came with the season pass it would be a good deal and bungie would deliver as usual but boy was I wrong. This game just involves a whole lot of time and grinding with little reward. To start off the multiplayer is fun but nothing special. I would say that if you were looking for a multiplayer only game go for battlefield, halo, or cod. The campaign was the worst part. Being a huge halo fan I thought the singleplayer would be amazing but it was just boring and repetitive. I have unfortunately put in 40 hours into this game and I can say it takes FOREVER to rank up. I'm at 26 right now and I can find no way to get past it. I just completed 3 queens bounties and received 3 legendary chestplates (I already have an exotic one) all I needed was anything else legendary, boots, helmet, gauntlets, but I got THREE chest armor. I dismantled them instantly and threw the game at a wall. This game take way too much time for the little or no reward they give you. I spent 15+ hours farming on the Comosdrone and I probably got 30 legendary engrams and 95% of them turn into rare gear that is 10x worse than the ones you have equipped. Also upgrading gear like my exotic chest is nearly impossible. You need 18-24 ascendant shards which are extremely hard to find and you have to spend hours upon hours on end patrolling venus for spirit bloom.

EDIT:

Well they came out with a new patch the other day that fixes a decent amount of problems I had with the game. They fixed it so when you do happen to get that extremely rare legendary drop, it will actually give you a legendary weapon/gear or better. However I still believe it's too little too late. I'm 28 now and I have literally completed the game. I did all strikes on 28 difficulty, did the raid, beat the campaign twice over, and invested 15 hours into their terrible multiplayer.

112180,1.0,False,"08 4, 2008",A11VECWKNTAQ2C,B000TG531G,Fredrick Nielson James III,"When the orginal Guitar Hero came out, that was one of the few games I really wanted for the PS2, which I did not have at the time. One of my friends got it, and I immediately fell in love. As a guitarist myself, I was really happy to see that people could play a rhythm-based game with rock music, as opposed to Dance Dance Revolution (which has primarily techno and dance music). Guitar Hero II came out first for the PS2, and later for the Xbox 360, with more songs, and downloadable content. With its added co-op and pro face-off two-player features, and an improved hammer-on/pull-off system, Guuitar Hero II is one of my favorite games on the 360. When it was announced that Neversoft was going to take Harmonix's place for the next Guitar Hero installment, I didn't know what to think. Screenshots for Guitar Hero 3 started circulating around the internet, I was both intrigued and disappointed. Intrigued by the new look and feel of the game, but disappointed that Neversoft was too stuck-up to keep the original design. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" must not be something heard around Neversoft's head honchos.
I have to say, playing GH3 for the first time, it was fun. As much fun as playing either of the other Guitar Hero games. That is, until I found what all was different. If you are allowed to either hammer-on or pull-off to the next note, you don't have to time it at all, which doesn't even make sense. One major problem I find with the game, is the fact that Neversoft decided that expert difficulty is going to be harder than anything else. How? By making any audible guitar noise a ""note,"" and the influx of three-note chords. Of course, that's the only way to make some of the songs challenging, seeing as every single song (except the battles) were singles at some point. Why is this bad? Because instead of choosing a song that would be good for Guitar Hero, a more popular song was chosen (specifically Miss Murder, Paint it Black, When You Were Young, and My Name is Jonas).
As for the guitar controller, Neversoft decided it would be for the best if the guitar had a detacheable neck. As for why, the only reason I can think of is for easy transport. But if you take the neck off, that's just one more thing to carry, and the neck doesn't stay in the body snugly, it jiggles around, ruining any long note you hit. The guitar I received has a jiggly neck, messed-up star power, and a slightly broken whammy bar. Star power is completely messed up. Sometimes it'll activate if I turn the guitar in any direction, and sometimes it won't activate unless I swing the guitar around like a maniac. Normally, I press the Back button, but even that doesn't work!

Zack & Wiki is a puzzle/adventure game with a heavy anime flavor; although the tiny amount of voice acting is in English, it's obvious that the actors are speaking their lines phonetically (""Sea Rabbits"" becomes ""See-Rabito,"" for instance).  Not that I mind, except that it's sort of incongruous with the written dialogue.  Other reviews have compared the gameplay to old-fashioned point-and-click adventures, but honestly, I don't think I would have made that connection if I hadn't read it beforehand; there are inventory items, but you don't keep them from one level to the next, and there's almost no plot to speak of.

To be fair, there are good things about the game; it's certainly original, and aside from the issue with the voice acting, the characters are pretty endearing; Zack's facial expressions are a hoot, and Captain Rose is adorable, in her anime-girl way.

Unfortunately, the thing that cripples Zack & Wiki is the gameplay itself.  The designers made it possible to die, for instance; that wouldn't bug me, except that way too often, the thing that kills you is something that you never in a million years would have seen coming unless you either worked on the design team or you possess the gift of second sight.  (Occasionally, especially in the ""Flute of the Growlin' Goblins"" level, the thing that kills you is the Wiimote misinterpreting the motion you're trying to make, or not make; in this level, there's a crank-operated gondola thing that sometimes keeps going even when you've stopped flailing your Wiimote.)  What's worse, the game seems intent on punishing you, and punishing you dearly, whenever you do get killed; not only do you lose all of your money and points, but unless you've got an expensive ""platinum ticket,"" you have to go all the way back to the beginning of the level.  There's a hints system, but not only are the hints even more expensive than the platinum tickets, they seem to have no bearing on the progress you've made; if you've made it halfway through the level and you buy a hint, you'll most likely be told something that you figured out for yourself twenty minutes ago.  (Plus, as you already know if you're reading this, we have an ""internet"" nowadays; why screw around with in-game hints when you can get all the hints you need from GameFAQs or any of a million other places?  I'd maybe understand if Zack & Wiki was made back when there was no internet to be had, but the thing's only a year old.  It's especially dumb when you realize that you can access that very same internet right from your Wii.)  And yeah, you can go back and replay levels to recoup your losses if you want, but why not make it reasonably possible to get through them on the first try instead of artificially lengthening the gameplay by making you repeat everything?

To be honest, I have no idea who the designers had in mind with this one; the overall tone suggests they intended the game for younger players, but I'm a full-grown adult and I can't even get through more than five minutes with my sanity intact.  I haven't beaten the game yet, and I'll probably keep trying, but at this point, it's more like a vendetta than anything else.  (Plus, it seems a shame to waste the money I spent on it, although I have a feeling that ship has already sailed.)  I should point out also that I totally saw the ""plot twist"" coming.

Yes, you're going to think that I got 200 hours of enjoyment out of it, but no I didn't.  I kept reading that if I get to X section or X level or X difficulty or X gear that the game comes alive.  700 days played in World of Warcraft.  Thousands of hours played in D2.  Having played many Blizzard games I kept giving this trash the benefit of the doubt but finally realized it was nothing but Blizzard fan boys talking and quit.

I believed in Blizzard Entertainment.  I really, really did.  From the start the game is doomed as the story has more holes than a block of Swiss cheese.  Then you're expected to play the game in a group where one guy always clicks skip story.  Playing solo is futile as your gear drops will be for another class, thus you need different classes in your group to share the loot.  Sounds pretty stupid right?  It is trust me.  What if the other guy in the group doesn't want to share?  You get nothing.  Fun huh?  So at this point you're stuck buying gear off the auction house for either millions of gold or real money.  This game is all about the fun of looking on the auction house for gear to beat a level.  Pure fail Blizzard!  Pure fail!

Then there are issues with the game's difficulty as it makes you play the game out on beyond easy mode where I lost 3 friends to boredom.  They refused to finish the first difficulty as they literally danced in the fire, intentionally got hit, and never died.  They said the game was crap and quit.  The game doesn't get decent until the 3rd time you've played it through.  So you have to play the exact same game 3 times before you get a challenge unless you fall asleep at the keyboard from boredom and die.  If you get to a section you can't get past just buy some gear off the auction house and more than likely you're back to god mode again.

Last point I want to touch on is that the game's end game is nonexistent.  As in it's hard not because it's fun, but because it cheeses you into death.  I play a Demon Hunter and most everything can one shot you unless you invested hundreds of million in gold into your gear.  Then you can last for 3 hits!  So assume you're not the type of person to spend real money on the auction house.  So you're going to get a ton of one hit deaths when you try to kill elite mobs.  You might die 9 times to a mob if you're not spending real money on gear.  Repair bill will be close to 50,000 gold.  The mob will drop about 3,000 gold in items and money.  So then you get in a group and pray that the mob decides to chase another person.  But there are tons more of them so you still die over and over.  Sounds like fun huh?  Who thought mechanics that can one shot kill you were fun?

I also want to mention that the game lags like no other.  Take the one shot mechanics from the aforementioned paragraph and sprinkle in some huge lag spikes and you can watch your characters die over and over to invisible mobs, invisible attacks, melee mobs hitting you clean across your screen, etc.  And there is a Hardcore mode where if you die you lose your character and all of it's gear.  That makes the game even more fun with lag!

Game is terrible.  Leave it in the store.  Do not buy.  It is not fun in the slightest when you get to Inferno.  The story is terrible.  The gear drops don't exist for you.  The auction house is the best place to level up.  And the real money auction house has the best gear.

My biggest complaint is that you have to pay for EACH extra character. This means you can't explore other classes without having to delete your original character.

The most you can pay for this game is $22 bucks or so, which is obscene. Most games will give you the maximum allowed characters for a lump sum fee, what a predatory gimmick to increase monthly fees.

Like most Japanese RPGs these days, it's too slow and linear. The gameplay and interface with players and NPCs are not smooth at all, transitioning with lag times. The soundtrack and voices are also squeaky and annoying.

I'm sure this game will probably be made free soon since people will be cancelling their subscriptions soon, as will I. You sure also check your credit card history since Square Enix had a thing in the past where they kept charging people who unsubscribed with FF11, a game I also abhorred and played for only a week.

Due to the design of the d pad its basically a plastic cross glued to a pole. And after wear and tear from usage the point at which the cross and the pole connects break. and the DPAD will just pop out. rending your d pad useless. you can try to glue it back but it will just break again from wear and tear.

I was very disappointed with the offerings. It's an XBOX 360 and therefore it lets you play your games, but this far into the product cycle, I'd expect so much more. However, if you want a large drive and HDMI it's the only choice you really have.

Here are a list of the problems I encountered, most due to the product itself:

[--] It is advertised as ""the newest"" version of the product, yet it is using the older chipset that is prone to E74 errors.

[--] The HDMI cable that comes with it is garbage. I plugged the 360 into my Denon 3806 receiver using the HDMI cable and there was no signal. I then plugged the 360 directly into my 60"" Sony SXRD via HDMI and there was no signal. I plugged my Digital Cable box directly into the TV using it and the picture was faded, blurry, snowy, fuzzy, dark, purple, unwatchable. I used another off-the-shelf HDMI cable and everything worked perfectly.

My PS3 didn't come with an HDMI cable at all, but what's the point of providing a component that doesn't even work?

[--] The two games come in a single combined case. My case was smashed and green plastic chunks were all over the place inside the product packaging.

[--] The headset that comes with the 360 continues to be disposable garbage.

[--] At the current price of this product, Microsoft should be providing a rechargeable controller battery by default rather than a pack of AAs.

[--] The XBOX 360 Elite packaging itself (the box Microsoft ships it in) had clearly been opened before I got it. The circular adhesive tape that closes one end of the product had been cut open and then a second piece of tape had been placed back over it. To Amazon's credit, when I asked them to confirm if I had a used 360 or a new one, they didn't even bother answering and just told me they had already shipped out a replacement that would arrive in 24 hours (and it did).",Typical 360 Experience - Including Failure,1244505600,13,{'Edition:': ' Elite 120GB Spring 2009 bundle'},

Secondly, all the resident evil games that come out for portable game systems suck. For once I thought I was getting a good one and the graphics are a shame. Total let down. And the characters and story are a total let down too. I returned that game and didn't the usual routine from the gamestop employee (would you like to reserve this capcom game?).

Capcom sold the ""exclusive rights"" to nintendo shortly before resident evil 4 came out. So the ps2 didn't get remake (but got ""gamecube exclusive resident evil 4"", what?) Result? the sales of kingdom hearts slaughtered the sales of resident evil remake (they probably would have anyway but the mistake still cost capcom money). Remake was the best of all the resident evil games and had the least attention because of a huge money costing deal that capcom made with nintendo. Realizing the mistake, capcom decides it's time to port resident evil 4 (with bonus in game content?) to the ps2 with the graphics it was originally designed for anyway.

Since the exclusive rights were originally sold to nintendo, capcom has been letting us down with a lot of titles and canceling work on certain games would buy.  Remake was canceled for another portable system because they are STILL ashamed of what they did to us..... and themselves.

Anyway someone reviewed this game and said play call of duty instead! If that is your criticism why don't you bash Halo? And if herbs are a problem, why don't you play games on ""very easy""...

I have played all the previous ones up until remake and some of the ones after, that's why it is still a sore spot today that I could not play Remake when I really wanted to, which were the ps2 days.

so do yourself a favor and do not buy this system and if you do buy it you will see what i mean when your systems dies and you have to send it in 6-100 times

I am really excited, this game is going to be so much fun.  Bethesda has created some of my favorite games, including the Fall Out games.  I get home and pop my copy into my XBOX 360 and the story boots up.  Not bad, I get to create my own character and this is going to be so much fun!  I start playing the campaign, and I feel as though there is some mistake.  Single Player is playing exactly like multiplayer.  I'm on the BRINK of wondering if I accidentally started a multi player campaign.  Nope!!!  Oh well, lets see what this game is all about. I play for about an hour, and I just cannot find any really good qualities in the game.  Now I am on the BRINK of getting a little worried.  Did I just shell out 60 clams to play this piece of junk game?  I shut down, and take the gamers walk of shame to my bedroom and retire for the night.

Day two:  Maybe I was wrong Yesterday, today is going to be a better day.  I resume my single player campaign and I start to realize that I am on the BRINK of throwing my controller through the television.  This game is actually worse today than I thought yesterday.  Maybe I am being Punked, but where is Ashton Kutcher?  I play on, and begin to have the sensation of being sucker punched in the balls.  Punked has been over for years, this is the real deal.  God, why has thee forsaken me?  I am on the BRINK of losing my temper.  I turn off the game and begin to think about the 4 hours of my life which were wasted on this game.  I won't ever get them back.  Then I begin to think about the 60 clams I gave to Game Stop for absolutely no reason at all.  I am now on the BRINK of crying.  All hope has been lost, I need help......fast.  I go back to Game Stop to trade my game in, and I am given 24 bucks for it.  At least all was not lost.  On the way home, I wonder how this abomination made it to a console. I may have got some of my money back, but my pride will not heal so easily.  I get home and decide to erase all evidence that this game was ever on my X BOX in the first place.  I'm done, I'm requesting extraction.  Hotel, Eagle, Lima. Pa Pa.-----HELP!!!!!

Please God, if you are out there, make it fast.  I am on the BRINK of insanity.

Day 3: Back to Call of Duty and the rest of the best, I guess I should wait next time.  Then I could read all of the reviews about a game before I buy it.  I feel a little better today, apparently I am not the only one who went insane.  However, there are a few people huffing gasoline or super glue  who gave this game a 5 star rating.  Really, can you be serious or do you work for Bethesda?  I am pretty sure it is the latter.  There are even people out there giving this game a 5 on the PS3, and that is with the entire Sony network being down.  How can you rate a game meant for multi player on the single player alone?  Oh, I forgot, Bethesda employs lots of people.  Now I am on the BRINK of taking a copy of this game and using it as a rectal dilator for whoever wrote positive reviews in the press for this game.

After reading the PS3 firmware bricking updates (confirmed on the Nyko Web site), I unpackaged the Frontman for an initial-slash-last go round attempt at trying before trashing this would be paperweight. Surprisingly enough - when plugged directly into a USB hub, this controller worked without a hitch. (It did not, however, respond to being piggybacked to a GH5 wireless fob). Sensitivity, synchronicity remained consistent across several songs as well.

Advice sensically remains to stick to standard GH5 controllers. Still, if you've got a dormant Frontman lying around pre 3.1 firmware, it may be worth re-attempting a go.

First of all, the story is too linear.  I thought it was okay, as long as story is good, but it isnt, it is overall very cliche and the story does not feel complete at all... Turns out square enix seems to be taking the advantage of the existing fan base and plans to squeeze out more money from the players by making a sequel.

I cant help but think that square enix spent too much time on the graphic and totally forgot to take care character development (this also apply to story as well)

The cover system sucks, half the time you can't get harry to take cover when you want him to, and you can't use your Patronus spell while under cover so you have to detach from your cover spot to ward off attacking Dementors, making yourself vulnerable to other enemies.  The spell selection controls are actually the only positive thing I can say about this game, you press the right bumper button which pauses the action and brings up the spell selection wheel which is helpful since there are a wide variety of spells to choose from, but you'll only wind up using 2 or 3 of them, basically the equivalent of a machine gun, shotgun or rocket launcher.

I have two computers that are far above the minimum requirements for the game but I could not make the game work in one of them no matter how hard I tried. From my research online I guess this is a major issue with many people. I even had trouble with the installation itself (the now famous redundancy error).  I cannot accept that they released a game that doesn't even install correctly.

Second the game itself.  It is an incredible step backwards from Sims 2.  We lose the load screens which indeed sucked, but we lose SO much more. The Sims very animation is poor, they always look a bit fat and their heads are too big (actually their faces are too big, their heads are ok). Those faces on the cover were generated on Photoshop, and no way they were a result from the game.

The jobs and needs were actually improved, but they are implemented on a game that lacks all that which made the previous ones great. The Sims seem more stupid and reluctant to follow directions. The number of objects is really small and the expressions and body language are the same from Sims 2 but the difference in color and animation only serves to remind you of what you aren't playing.  The greater loses are with the female Sims they never look feminine at all. It is very strange.
That and some crashes made me place the game back on the shelf.  In a couple of months I'm sure there will be a patch (or more...) that will reduce the crashes and the number of objects will larger with downloads.

Anyway, over the months she'll try it again, only to be frustrated by the unclear goals and tricky maneuvers. And half the time, I was no help! (Again, I never got into console gaming.)

There are some good things about this game, and many more bad.  I'll summarize the comments to the most pertinent issues.

GOOD:

1.  The gameplay is generally fast.  There's no downtime.  There aren't any ludicrous checkpoints that merely prolong the mission.  In MW2 and MW3, you constantly had to move from one checkpoint to another, capturing or clearing positions.  Or, you had numerous escort missions that got bland really fast.  BO2 has far fewer of these checkpoints.  Instead, you know what the objective is, you know there are plenty of bad guys around, and you have a linear path to the objective.  In other words, shoot 'em up and finish the mission.

2.  The technology is interesting, although not completely realistic.  The Modern Warfare and Call of Duty games typically pride themselves on staying true to the technology.  There are some reviewers who disliked the BO2 future tech, and although they have some valid points, the gadgets aren't all that distracting.  The only irritation is the wingsuit at the last mission--but you're only in it for a moment.

3.  The soundtrack fits.  Thus far, all of the MW and BO games have soundtracks that support the missions.  They don't overwhelm you, nor distract you.  Just the right stuff to make you feel as if time is of the essence and you need to push the objective.

4.  The optional side missions can be skipped.  Plenty of people will tell you that the side missions are pointless.  I tend to agree.  I'm glad that at least we can skip them.  The one thing I want to emphasize is that some people will enjoy these missions, and the game at least gives everybody the option to try them.

BAD:

1.  The story was ludicrously bad.  I don't expect these types of games to have powerful stories.  Not all games can be Spec Ops: The Line.  But at least the story needs to make sense.  MW2 and MW3 had the same storyline, but you knew what it was about.  You could follow the motivations of the characters and opposing sides.  In BO1, the characters drove the story, and you got the experience their points of view.  BO2, however, has what seems to be a hastily put together plot.  You get an over the top bad guy whose motivations are completely ridiculous.  Your main hero has absolutely no emotional connection with the player--in fact, you don't even know anything about the main hero besides very basic information about his father.  The major supporting characters are again unrealistically over the top.  It was as if Activision created the missions first, then decided they needed some lose connection.  If that was their goal, they failed at that meager aim.

2.  The flashbacks are poorly used.  The flashback missions are interesting because they take you out of the otherwise incomprehensible main story.  However, they are just poorly used.  You get zero explanations for what's going on, why certain characters are involved in the mission, or what the overall objectives are.  Apparently, because flashback missions were an option, Activision decided they should be put in without reasonable exposition.

3.  There is no character development.  The last two comments pretty much sum up this issue.

4.  The ending is incredibly pointless.  The ending of the game makes no sense.  So, after 5 hours of playing the game as the main character, not knowing anything about him, the ending has him quitting his job.  Ok...why?  Is it because the world is falling part, his friend got hurt, he learned secrets about his past, or that he's up for retirement?  WHY IS HE QUITTING?  Activision expected me to feel bad or sorry for him at the end?  Why?  I didn't even get to know this character.  Moreover, besides the lack of character development, the ending of the entire story was terribly presented.  What happens after you kill the bad guy (or capture him)?  If Activision wants to make BO3, then maybe it should give me a reason to expect the next game.  If the next BO3 will have a completely different story arc, then at least FINISH THIS STORY PROPERLY!

5.  Boring, unimaginative gameplay.  Yes, the game is fast paced.  That's good.  But it's utterly boring.  Been there, done that.  I'm not asking for a revolutionary gameplay.  I just want something that's different.  You know what's been done.  You can change how to approach the missions.  Imagine playing the same missions from a completely different perspective--hell, the fact that you have no connection to the main player won't damage you completing a mission from the viewpoint of a minor character.  The point is, give me the option of playing the missions from different viewpoints.  At the start of the mission, do I go in guns blazing like the main hero, or covertly infiltrate as another character and provide support when the firefight begins?  It's the same damn mission with the same boring objective, but at least I can experience it differently if I choose to do so.

6.  Graphics leave much to be desired.  Everybody in this damn game looks like they were made from wax.  The light doesn't shine off their skin properly, their expressions are typically unrealistic, and their movements are hardly believable.  Look at Halo 4 if you want a good example.  Halo 4 is a beautifully created game that is just as action-packed as this one is supposed to be.  So why is it that there haven't been any worthwhile improvements in the graphics from the previous version?  Apparently, Activision thought the graphics were good enough--which seems to be their motto for this entire game.

OVERALL:

I wanted to like this game.  I heard plenty of good things about it, read many reviews, and only then made the investment.  But I hated it from the very first mission to the very last.  It was a big letdown.  Perhaps it's the fault of the hype machine.  I'll give you that.  But Activision still made a game that was bland and emotionless.

Perhaps you are thinking of purchasing the game for multiplayer.  Fine.  Then the gripes about the story don't matter as much.  But be realistic.  If you get the game for multiplayer only, then you know you're getting nothing new.  You've been playing the same idiotic multiplayer in MW2, MW3 and BO1.

The fact is that we don't have money to throw away.  I suspect Activision doesn't either.  So why produce such a crappy game?  Why make it seem like you just phoned it in?  You're spending millions of dollars on R&D and marketing.  You know people will want to buy the game because the previous one was good.  So why not put in the effort to make it truly unique?

We're buying video games so that for brief periods we can stop worrying about life--bills and family and money.  I just want to enjoy a game an hour at a time, and immerse myself in a different experience.  But when I spend $60, I want that money to be well spent.  Think of it this way: a typical person can purchase a week's worth of meals for $60.  If I'm going to go hungry for one week, then I expect to be rewarded for it.  Unfortunately, it feels like I merely threw that cash down the drain.

For those who've played the game, don't you feel a little cheated?  Didn't you have reasonable expectations?  Didn't the marketing make it sound as if this was going to be a game worth buying?  Be honest:  did you really enjoy this game, or are you merely satisfied?  It's the difference between being full and not being hungry any more.

For those who have yet to purchase this game, please think twice.  You'll hear and read many reviews to the contrary.  Good for them.  Those people evidently had a different experience with this game.  But before you do anything, ask yourself if you've got the right expectations from this game.  If you're ok with low expectations, you'll probably find the game worth the money.

This is how Amazon is justifying 1.5 stars using the figures from today (3/14).
3,279 total reviews and 2,951 are 1 star. So 90% are 1 star, leaving 10% as higher than 1 star, right? Unfortunately amazon is apparently using a weighted review system.
5star-109 = weighted 5x109 = 545
4star- 56 = weighted 4x56 = 224
3star - 58 = weighted 3x58 = 174

I went to the Steam support pages like I was told to, and I read this:

""... you must have a copy of your purchase receipt from within the last 90 days to have the CD Key moved to your account.

""We do not accept receipts from online auction websites or used software vendors. If you do not provide a purchase receipt, Valve will not be able to transfer the CD Key.""

I can't believe that anyone accepts this as a reasonable way to sell consumers a game in a box, but I guess they do!

I read a thread on some Half-Life 2 forum where the users were telling a guy not to bother Valve, the software creators, with questions about their policy, but rather just to return his used game to whoever he bought it from.

Unbelievable!

From what I hear, maybe if I send the right person at Valve an actual photo of my box, and wait two months, I might be allowed to play.  However, that's certainly not what the text on the Steam support page says.

If this is really the accepted practice regarding used copies of Half-Life 2, then what is Amazon doing letting their marketplace sellers sell these used copies?

Any would-be buyers of this game, PLEASE take this as a caveat; I really want to convey just how lousy this game is. Any comparison of this game to the rest of the series is ludicrous, but anyway...
As I said before, you play the game as the character Ryu, a government grunt. Mankind has been forced to live under the earth due to reasons lost in antiquity, and the citizens are placed into their positions via a rating system (a ratio - the closer the ratio is to 1, the more potential a person has, and thus the greater station this person is allowed to have). Surprisingly, the higher your ratio, the closer to the surface you are allowed to live, despite the conviction that the outside world is poisonous. Anyway, the purpose of the game is to climb out from the bowels of the earth in an attempt to reach the sky. This is the story. If you find it excellent, well, to each his own, but personally,I don't think this tale stands up to the likes of Xenosaga, .hack:infection, Suikoden III, FFX, etc.
However, complicating matters is the D-Hunger gauge, against which I have railed in the past. As you progress through the game, this gauge constantly rises (increasing about 1/100 of a percent every 2-3 seconds on its own). SHould your character transform into a dragon (or use other special abilities), the rate of increase rises dramatically. Assuming you never use ANY of these abilities, however, you essentially have 20000-30000 seconds to finish your game (or about 6-8 hours). Failing at this, it is game over. In fact, you have to restart your game from the beginning. There is NO carrying over of statistics; what CAN be carried over are the weapons and armor you have equipped, any items you have stored away, the skills you have learned and ""party experience"", which can be used to boost your characters upon the replay. Furthermore, if you are considering beating the game on your first go around, don't. It is physically impossible (I know, I tried it out). I have a lot of words to describe this atrocious system, but ""realistic"" isn't the first to come to mind.
I believe in innovation, when it makes a game more fun. However, this is absurd. You want the trick to beat the game? Simply play through as far as you go twice, remembering to store all of your acquired items and NEVER use party experience. That way, on your third time through, you can buff up your characters so much that they will destroy any enemy they come across (yes, I decided to go back and finish the game). Hence, an 8 hour game becomes a 24 hour game, since every scene is seen three times. The fact that you can't save often is a blessing in disguise - saving doesn't really help you anyway (the D-Hunger gauge isn't going anywhere). Oh, and for a more ""realistic"" gaming experience, notice that you have a ""quit"" command. This command essentially allows you to save at a certain spot, and then use you dragon abilities to try to acquire certain skills and items you might not otherwise be able to acquire. Oh sure, you'll die, but you can start over at the save spot, with all of the abililities now in your repertoire. In fact, the guide (which may be the most useless instruction guide in all of gaming, oftem times confusing me more than instructing me) tells you to use this strategically. The realism is overwhelming. The moral is: if you try to beat the game on one walkthrough, forget it! Instead, the system rewards ineptitude over ingenuity.
If you are one of those (sad to say many) people who simply cannot stand the mainstream, and would sooner gouge out their eyes than play a game everyone else is playing, this might be for you. To be sure, the system is innovative, and I am sure it will never rear its ugly head again. However, if you enjoy fun game, or if you simply don't want to waste fifty bucks on a stinker, stay the hell away from this abomination. Play Xenosaga (another innovative game), or .hack, or even Final Fantasy X for the nth time. This game reeks...",This is the last time - I promise!,1045958400,44,,

I just don't understand what game you reviewers were playing.  It sure wasn't BioShock.  I will try my best to not sound like yet another ""This sucks""  kind of person.  The graphics are amazing; the spotlight lighting and shading is pretty advanced.  Sometimes the enemy characters are so in the dark, they are hard to make out, but their features look pretty believable.  I also liked the Big Daddy character mulling around.  The story itself is also ok; a little different from the humans against the aliens shooters we are used to.  But, I am paying $60 to actually play a game not to foam at the mouth for eye-candy.

First, the gameplay is just so amazingly basic;  You pick up guns, ammo, plasmids and you run around the dungeon like environment as characters pop up or the occasional turret or flying thingy.  This may not be so bad except for the fact that you don't really get to use your full range of motions.  You don't ever have to attack somebody above you or below you.  It is a basic forward shooting, dungeon FPS (almost kind of reminded me of Doom 1).  Oh yea, all of that is kind of pointless because if you aren't strapped for time, you can just respawn and finish off your characters without any real penalties.

Let's look at Halo2 or Gears of War, for example.  In Halo 2, you might have to take out a bunch of weaker characters close up and then snipe the more difficult ones from a distance while using your soldiers as bait.  In Gears, it is the same thing; you are ducking behind walls corners so you don't get toasted by the Boomers, hoping your friendly characters might kill something.  In Bioshock, I just kind of ran around clubbing people with the wrench because I never really had any ammo.  I was bored to tears.

Not a big deal, but what happened to Animation sequences or End chapter sequences.  All I am getting is that silly radio message popup or maybe a diary message which I won't normally listen to.  Those aren't very exciting and makes it hard to appreciate the story.

Maybe I am wrong, It could be possible.  I am flexible in my analysis of the game if you want to comment on it.

And I am only at 60% completion, so maybe that other 40% is where the amazing part of the game is.  I don't know.  To be honest, I don't think I can continue.",The most overrated game in the history of games,1190419200,46,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

For the past year, I have stood by Final Fantasy VII saying that it is the best RPG ever created. I was wrong. It WAS the best RPG ever created in 1997. When FF VII first came out on the PSX it was said to be the best game ever put on the PSX. They were right. When it was released in '97 the graphics in the game blew away the graphics of previous games and later games. The storyline itself was gripping and although it had it's dull moments, it culminated in a spectacular finish.
Now I think the reason that most of you think this game sucks is because it has been 7 years, 7 YEARS!! since this game hit the shelves and every year we see new games and flashier graphics. And you DARE compare this game to a PS2 GAME!!!! It's just not fair. The capabilities of the PSX could never, in a million years, rival that of the PS2's capabilities. It's just not gonna happen.

After finally giving up on trying to install the game without Steam, I created a Steam account, and let it prepare to launch my game for over 2 hours.  Then, when I finally had a new Desktop icon to double click, an error message indicated that my system didn't meet the minimum requirements...

By then, I was so worn out and upset that I went to bed.

The next morning, which was last Friday, I discovered I could no longer access the Internet with my AT&T account.  I tried all day, without success.

Saturday, I was the first customer at the Radio Shack where I bought my computer.  I wasted two hours of my life while the same Radio Shack employee who set up my AT&T internet service tried to fix the problem.  Finally, I left him my laptop, and my phone number.

Sunday morning, I called Radio Shack to see if they'd fixed my laptop yet.  The man I'd left it with informed me that there was nothing wrong with the laptop; I had simply used more than my monthly bandwidth, so my usage had been suspended for the rest of the month.

I would call it a semi next-gen console because of this. The graphics can be more compared with the GameCube. The only improvement is that the games are in widescreen and a slight improvement in picture quality. Some would say, though, that some of the GameCube games had better graphics. I can see that ini some games made for the Wii. I can say that the Wii has not been a good investment. This console does not have very many good games. I would say that for the limited games put out by first and third party companies, only about 20% are passable. The only game even worth a look is the Zelda Twilight Princess but then that is also available on the GameCube and I already had that. The controllers are what made this console new in a sense. But the use was force implemented in games such as Zelda Skyward Sword. Problems with the controllers were really apparent in games like New Super Mario Brothers Wii where the jumping mechanics were not well implement. I can understand why people complained about the dash. Nintendo realized the problem and put out a new controller to correct some of the problems with the Wiimote Plus. But by then the damage was done. Further, who wants to spend another forty bucks for another controller? I got the console in order to play Zelda Skyward Sword as it was not available for the GameCube as I am a fan of the Zelda series. But after having played that game I can say that it was not worth getting the Wii for. The other games were mot very good. It reminds me of the experience I had with the GameCube where there were lots of bad games. The best games for this console is actually the Wii sport and that can get quite boring without others to share the experience with. If you are getting the Wii for the fitness game, research shows that it is not an effective way to get fit. So that's out the window. Now, this console just sits collecting dust. The only plus is that it does play GameCube games but then I already have a GameCube. If you buy this, you will need to buy the GameCube controllers. I spend most of my time on the Playstation 3. I spend a small portion on the Xbox 360 as it is only for campaigns. I don't play online on Xbox 360 as I refuse to play sixty bucks just to play my games online. I used to subscribe to Xbox Gold but then after comparing online games (I even had Call of Duty World at War for both consoles and saw no difference in graphics or gameplay) I realized that Xbox Gold was a waste of money. As far as online gaming on the Wii goes, it is very archaic. You cannot actually hear what the other players are saying. Of course you can chat with your friend but the system is terrible. To add insult to injury, Nintendo came out with a microphone that they discontinued because it was that bad. That is a far cry from the Sony Playstation 3 headphones which I use for online gaming. If you want to know what it is like to play online with great sound and microphone, the Sony Playstation 3 headphones are simply the best. And don't get me on the code system just to paly with your friends online. That is just simply a pain in the ass to say the least.

Alright, so the game finally starts for me, and do you know the first.. THE FIRST THING that happens to me? I can't find my ship. I'm on a little island, wandering around. And I don't know what to do. WELL I eventually see this signal flare out in the water.. I swim to it, and its like ""Do you want to spawn back at your ship?"" Uh, yes please!

I also got attacked, on this island, right out of the gate. The same fools that attacked me had also sunk my ship. BEFORE I EVEN managed to figure out anything.

The next thing that happens, is well I got in my ship, FINALLY.. doing it solo.. and it takes me forever, but my first destination is ""Booty Island"" I figure, why not? sounds like a great name! I make it there, I wander around ""Snake island"" because that's what it really should have been called.. I then head over to ""Thieves Haven"" .. I grab a treasure chest, and I head up to.. ""Plunders Outpost"" basically an Island where you turn your stuff in.. A little hub area. I get killed, my loot stolen. And that's garbage.  Complete and utter garbage.

Do I regret my purchase? as it stands, very much so. This reminds me of the days when I started playing multiplayer on console.. I think it was Halo2.. and I got spawn killed, over and over and over.

First, this PS2 game takes the world of Yu-Gi-Oh! and transplants it into the middle ages, with the War of the Roses. The houses of Lancaster and York are vying for the throne of England, and only cards can settle it.
OK, I don't mind that. I love English history, and I also enjoy card games. So into the tutorial we head. While they go over every step in the game, it's one gigantically long rush of about 1/2 hour or more. And instead of letting you practice the commands and repeat them, it's a slideshow-like sequence where you just keep hitting X ... X ... X. You really need a walkthrough to print out to have it all available and ignore their slideshow.
Finally you get to the game. You choose a default deck and take it into ""battle"" as you try to move across England. Problem 1 - there's no practice! You go from that slideshow right into a nasty battle that many find difficult to win. You are often dealt awful cards that even skilled players find it hard to win with. It's hard to learn the game when your monsters are stomped easily left and right.
At least you might have pretty things to look at and listen to while you die, right? Wrong! The graphics for the cards are awful. You can barely tell what element something is or anything else. Even the important numbers are hard to decipher. And for sound, you get the same droning loop of synth music again and again.
Cardplay is new and unusual, with monsters moving across the board and facing each other on different terrain types. It's sort of interesting but can be extremely frustrating, especially for new players. You do get a semi-cool 3d ""quick battle"" when the cards meet, but even that is on a boring background and lasts maybe 5 seconds.

Don't get me wrong, there are fun aspects to the game; spear-fishing, for instance, is a hoot, and after spending days (in game-time) on the brink of starvation, the opportunity to finally see a full Hunger meter is truly satisfying.  I should also mention in all fairness that the game does make good, if limited, use of the DS touch screen and microphone, mostly through the aforementioned spear fishing and through fire building.  Unfortunately, these bright spots are too few and far between to add up to a game worth playing, or at least paying full-price for, and I spent much of my time feeling angry and frustrated at the game's nonintuitive and often downright illogical gameplay.  Bow-hunting, for instance, is almost impossible without the use of snare traps, and even then it's irritatingly hit-or-miss; using snare traps essentially entails watching an animal as it walks, making a guess as to where its path will take it, and placing the trap and hoping your prediction was correct.  If it was correct, great; if it wasn't, and the animal changes direction at the last second, you're screwed, because traps can't be reused once set.  You can also capture and domesticate a goat for the ostensible purpose of obtaining milk, but even though I did everything I was supposed to do (capture goat--check, bring home--check, provide partner with bottles--double check), the goat went unmilked until it finally keeled over dead in the night.  But what really killed the game, and what made me lose interest and leave it unfinished, is the fact that halfway through the game, you're required to leave your partner behind at camp and strike out on your own for a few days, making sure that she has enough food and water so that she won't die while you're gone, and the game offers absolutely no explanation for why you can't just take her with you even though she's perfectly capable of making the trip with your assistance.  Worse yet, at the cave which serves as your home-away-from-home, there are TWO ready-made (not to mention unexplained) sleeping pallets, only serving to underscore the question.  And worse even than THAT, she proves time and again to be so wildly inept at taking care of herself--flatly ignoring the barrel full of fresh water and letting herself slowly die of thirst, for instance--that you may well have to abandon your quest midway through and run home to stop her from killing herself.  (She also has an unfortunate tendency to wander away from the cave, leaving you to search for her before she dies of exposure.  You may feel tempted to just let her go and be rid of her, but the game won't let you do that; if she dies, the game ends.)  You'll most likely end up running home a few times anyway, as the game only lets you stockpile a few days' worth of provisions for her to live off of, and exploring the ruins will almost certainly take far longer than that.  I can't imagine why the game's designers would intentionally include such a flawed puzzle, but it's there, it can't be avoided, and it frustrated me to no end.

Since I've already rambled on far too long, I'll only mention in passing the game's thinly-disguised sexism in the form of a male character who does all the hunting and gathering and a female character who hardly ever leaves home, as well as the sudden jarring digression into Tomb Raider territory that comes with exploring the ruins.  Once you've beaten the game, you have the option of playing it through again from your partner's point of view, a page clearly taken from the book of Resident Evil 2 (fortunately, that's where the similarity ends!), but since I gave up on the game halfway through the first playthrough, I can't offer any opinions on that particular aspect.  Honestly, though, the fact that the first half of the game is so hard to get through with your patience intact proves--to me, anyway--that it really doesn't matter if the second half is enjoyable or not.  All in all, while ""Lost in Blue"" does offer a few innovative and fun gameplay elements, the aggregate experience was so overwhelmingly negative for me that I can only recommend this game if you're not the kind of person who is easily frustrated, and even then, you should probably look for a used copy.",Where's Wilson when you need him?!,1180828800,7,,

200485,1.0,True,"05 10, 2011",ARTRFSZQPWY9I,B002DC8GKE,Ian B. Cooper,"Got Brink yesterday. This is an update to my earlier review. All I can say is, this is one frustrating game!

Firstly, the deep storyline I was looking forward to - all that potentially rich back-story that was hinted at in the pre-release videos and advertising... well it's not there. We get a couple of sentences from a disembodied voice telling how the Ark was a self-sustaining green vision of the future - and that's it! You don't even get a feeling for which side you identify with more, before the game forces you to choose a side. Talk about lost potential!

Then you get to customize your character. This is actually kinda fun (though weirdly laggy). Still, there are some very nice, unusual-looking characters with some great artwork. Then again, my daughter feels left out because there are no women characters available.

Then you go to the missions. This is not handled in a smooth way at all. If you choose to save the Ark you just choose a mission and you get a cut scene with a guy almost incomprehensible generic African accent babbling on about terrorists. Yes, it's the tired old 'terrorists have kidnapped someone, stolen a data chip, etc.', formula that we've seen in all the worst post-9/11 games.

Then comes combat.

I haven't seen a shooter with combat this bad since... Actually I've NEVER seen combat this bad. It's basically like an arcade 'duck hunt' game with targets that move around as if they're on some sort of futuristic speed-type drug. And you have to pump a clip or two into them in order to take them down. Meanwhile, even on easy difficulty you get killed if you get shot with a few rounds - and the AI have perfect aim. True, sometimes they're too stupid to even shoot at you at all, but when there are ten of them spawning around you, you haven't much hope.

I played on easy difficulty. I don't know anyone who can beat the missions on this game, but I know I can't. Easy difficulty is not supposed to pose a challenge! It's supposed to be easy - that's why it's called 'easy'. When you're developing a game, the difficulty levels are not there for the elite players - they'll choose 'super hard' every time. The rest of us need options that make it easier on us. Starting at 'impossible to do on your first five tries' is not 'easy'. I don't know why so many developers don't get this.

When you respawn (which you do a LOT), there's no option to respawn at a newly-captured station - you have to go all the way back to the start. So you end up spending a lot of time incapacitated, then you spend a long time running back to the action, then you get about two seconds of shooting (because the game's choke points are suicide). Then it's rinse and repeat.

The cut scenes seem tacked-on. None of them flow into or from the combat like other modern games' cut scenes do. So you get a jarring feel which make me suspect that the game just wasn't finished. I'd say this game needed another six months of development before it was ready for release. The developers have the kernel of a good game here, but it's not polished - heck, it's not even ready to be polished. This is a 'pre-alpha' version of the game Brink could have - should have - been.

This is in all ways a 1990s style shooter. None of the last decade's improvements are in this game - no cover, no CoD-style aim assist etc. - it's just run, shoot, respawn. Single player is incredibly frustrating and disorienting - and it only lasts a long time because the missions are almost unbeatable even on easy difficulty. Finishing a mission is virtually impossible in single player.

The smooth movement that was advertised is haphazard to say the least - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Assassin's Creed does it right - this game, not so much.

The only good thing about this game is the character generation.

I've given this game a fair try. This one is going back to Amazon - assuming they accept opened games. I hate to say this, but it's basically a great character customization game with a Starsiege-Tribes-era FPS tacked on.

I've been playing video games for over 30 years, and of all the games I had high hopes for, this is the absolute worst.

They purposely marketed it based on previous versions, and then stripped away what made the core of those versions great.  It is basically a ""shell"" of a city simulation game.

With this new ""reboot"" - there are no local saves to your own harddrive.  If you create a city, it is destroyed, you can not go back to its initial state.

No terraforming (Yes, citybuilding without the ability to modify the land).

The city tiles are very small.  There are ""hints"" that they may expand this in the future.  Many are skeptical that it will be free - more than likely, they will charge extra for any add-ons or modifications to the game (like they have Sims 3).

If you saved your game on one server, can't reconnect to it, you have to start over with a new city on a different server.  There is no consistency - again, all at the discretion of EA - again, no player control.  You can research this for yourself, all over the internet - you cannot play on your own terms.  You are tied to whenever the servers are available, and as you can see, with the launch disaster, people cannot play when or how they want.

Servers may be shut down by EA at anytime, at their discretion.  Again, you can not save to your own hard drive, therefore, if and when they shut down the servers, your ability to play the game that you paid $60-80 for (plus any additional add-ons) is gone.  EA has an extensive history of this, check their website for their evergrowing list of obsolete online games and the internet in general.

They purposefully hold back items/tools/building sets, in order to sell them separately - at this time, again, no guarantee on servers, so, all this money is potentially thrown into a game that ultimately is not yours - you are just ""renting it"".

There are inherent flaws in the gameplay that are becoming more and more evident, aside from server launch issues.  Please check any hardcore SimCity fansite (i.e, Simtropolis), for honest, extensive descriptions of these flaws.

If you want to experience true city building, where you pay for a game that you can save on your own system, play anytime, create any size city, has strong community support, for over 10+ years, with add-ons, at no extra cost to you, unless you want to donate, I highly suggest trying SimCity 4.  Then, if you do try this new ""reboot"" - compare how you can play, when you can play, and how much creativity and independence you are allowed and decide which one is for you.  At least you know SimCity 4 is cheaper, is around to stay, and isn't dependent on EA's unreliable servers.

There is a petition at change.org, titled, ""Electronic Arts Inc.: Remove ""Always Online"" DRM from SimCity and future games."", started by Ryan Lashley, at this time, with over 70,000+ signatures, asking to take the game offline.

Well first this game is Call of Duty with vehicles.  That may or may not be a bad thing.  EA/DICE  sees the success of the Call of Duty franchise, and has decided to try to take a piece of it.  If you like Call of Duty, this may be a good game.  If you are like me a loooong time player of BF2(2000+ hours, yes 2000), then this game is an insult.

It's typical EA (game play wise). EA has no loyalty to game play style of BF2 or the massive community that made the old Battlefield series what it is today.  BF2 was a paced FPS; balanced and heavily reliant on strategy.  BF3 is not.  It's alot of hiding in bushes, ""spray and pray"" style shooting.  Again good for CoD-style FPSs, but a crime when compared to its predecessor.

Overall the Gameplay is fast paced and enjoyable for the modern ""realism"" gameplay, but as a longtime BF2 player, this nearly made me weep.  <--This is my red flag for any of you BF2 veterans out there.

-------BATTLELOG-----------

EA's attempt to make a gaming community (more on that later), forced upon its customers.  It tries to sell it as easier than an in game browser, supposedly loading faster as well.

The truth is is that while BF3 may be faster to load up from desktop to game play than BF2 or BF:BC2, this is only true on one start-up.  In other Battlefield games,  leaving a server and joining a new one is MUCH faster= Leave server->server menu->join new server.

Bf3 launches from your web browser (more on that later too) and when leaving the server, BF3.exe is closed, so to switch servers means you have to wait for the BF3.exe to load EACH time you wish to change servers/game modes/map specific servers.

A further feature is squad management.  This is built into BF3, but also in battlelog to manage friends who want to game with you or the same squad in the same server.  And it's completely broken, the sales pitch on battlelog is BS.  It's not totally awful, it does have it's merits, but is a step back from BF2/BFBC2's menus, even with the latter's flaws.

-----BATTLELOG PART 2--------

HERE's where the real pain in the butt starts.  Suppose you are like me and like to customize your Web Browser.  Battlelog will not allow that.  You must disable or heavily configure MOST plug-ins in your browser JUST TO MAKE BF3 EVEN WORK.  You want to secure your browser AND play BF3? too bad.  Battlog will make sure you must run your web browser naked as can be in order for you to even load a round of BF3 up.  I tinkered with settings for hours to keep my browser as I like it (secure) and came up with nothing but hangs and crashes from BF3.  Nice.

-------ORIGON----------------

EA's Version of STEAM.  Mandatory to install if you want to play BF3.  Totally unnecessary and a system resource hog.  Also in BETA stage.  Nice, an incomplete product sewn onto another product with no discernible advantages for the customer .  Origon is a STATED scanning tool used by EA to gather information on you.  Naysayers say its watching you, and realistically that's not really true.  What it really does is harvest information on you while leaving you anonymous, but using your metrics to use or sell for marketing purposes.

I am A STEAM (Valve Corporation) user, and Steam may or does do the same thing.  This is big issue in the whole Steam/Origon debate.  However, history has shown that STEAM has a record of treating their customers above board while EA has shown rudeness and contempt to its customers for years.  Origon, again is still in BETA, and any research shows that with Origons many many problems comes very impolite and intolerant EA customer service.

-----""COMMUNITY""------------

Since EA is selling its Battlelog as some great community feature, ill comment on this.  BF3 the game itself is RIFE with extreme expletives and swear words.  However, even the most paltry use of vulgarities in any EA/Origon/Battlelog forums will !BAN!  your origon account making your Bf3 purchase TOTALLY YES TOTALLY unplayable.  Slandering EA on it's many faults leads to the same result.  EA's sense of community is about as welcoming as a kick to the ****.

Further,  several complaints about a few big issues in the game led EA to promise and tout that the fix was coming in the next patch.  Which didn't happen.  A patch came out indeed, but only a minority of major complaints (promised to be fixed) actually were fixed.  Perfect example of EA's nature ""we'll do what you please and tell YOU what to like"".

------BF2 SEQUEL-----------

BF2 wasn't as realistic, it took a good amount of bullets to take a guy down.  I loved that about BF2.  you couldn't just walk around spraying bullets to get kills. Realism is the new thing and kills are as easy as maintaining a heartbeat.  But it's double edged, a slight breeze kills you in BF3.

NO COMMANDER MODE!  EA stated that commander mode was too advanced and not new player friendly enough Read:Call of Duty doesnt have it.  This was a huge part of BF2 for me.  Only 2 people out of 64 could be commander so if you didn't know how it worked, someone else surely did, no problem.

EA touts teamwork in BF3, but removes a feature REALISTICALLY on IRL battlefield and HEAVILY used in BF2.  An over-arching commander that can see the map and direct the whole team.

MAPS-  Maps are tiny in this game,  and map that is of decent size is just a small center of activity surrounded by empty fields.  BF2 had vast maps of various places of hotspot firefights, capture points spaced so far out that victory wasn't about rolling point to point, it was predicting and strategizing, one capture point could turn the tide.  Now, if a capture point falls it's a quick run over to the point to recap it.

Furthermore,  trying to capture a waypoint was dangerous for a small squad or Vs. a tank.  The commander could supply drop, vehicle drop, or artillery the position for support.  Not now.  But since capture points are so close in BF3, there's no risk involved in capturing a point.  if you died, you'll respawn a short hike away.  no risk, no strategy.

Everymap is smaller, Karkand size maps.  Long gone are the awesome wars of Dragon Valley, Fushe Pass, and Kubra dam.  With these close quarter maps comes the spray and pray, kill/die alot fighting, zero strategy.  Oh Hi CoD!.

------CONCLUSION-----------

Alot of this review speaks of things outside the game and may look unfair, however, as all of this is mandatory and/or bound to happen, you get to deal with all of this just to play one game.

The gameplay is definitely a rival to CoD, short here, better there.  I have no hate for CoD or it's fans, good for them that they love their franchise.  What bothers me is EA abandoned the BF series' core aspect and fans just to get a corner on the CoD style FPS market. <-Again a red flag for my BF2 brethren.

I don't have a huge budget (Buying these left be with 50 cents in the bank) so I figured hey, they're 7.1 (Pseudo) and 20 bucks with a lot of good reviews. Ordered them on the 3rd of July, got them (To my immense surprise) on the 4th.

Pro's
- The sound quality is decent if you're not an audiophile. Not great, but not bad and has the standard 20-20 frequency range. Bit thumpy and hollow sounding, but again, if you're not into high quality sound it's not really a problem.
- The controls dongle is simple and clearly labeled using icons so it doesn't matter what language you speak, you should be able to figure everything out instantly.
- USB connetivity and a decently long cord. Not mega long, but if you're at a computer desk like I am they're plenty long enough.
The cord is the 'wrapped' kind so it seems plenty durable.
- Large enough to fit people with bigger heads without feeling like a vice.

The cons
- Construction seems pretty iffy. It's not immediately fragile, but I wouldn't suggest people get rough with them at all.
- The Mic only flips down like the pictures and description say. What they DON'T say is that this means the mic is nowhere near your mouth and'll pick up ambient sounds as easily as your speech. If you're in a quiet room with a quiet computer then it's not a problem. If you're in a noisy room with a noisy computer? Biiiiig problem.
- Lastly the 7.1 This is where it fails, and fails hard. When I first installed these they auto-set as a simple stereo headset. I did a sound check, a mic check, and everything worked. Not necessarily well (IE the mic) but they worked. Then I tried to set the pseudo 7.1 up and oops, now they don't work AT ALL. I've tried resetting all the settings, unplugging them and then plugging them back in, I've even restarted my computer several times. No luck, they're dead Jim.

Gameplay:
The AI is horrible, you run through linear maps through 8 missions, and there isn't too much to it. Expect most of the enemies to have their backs to you so you can easily kill them, expect no sound detection for the stealth so you can run around behind an enemy and he won't even notice, and expect to miss most of the shots you shoot given the shot detection is flawed. It's frustrating to play this game.

Multiplayer Gameplay:
The multiplay gameplay is horrid. You can only really play deathmatch and given how horrid this game is you can't even find people to really play with.

Graphics:

It takes a degree of technicality that stops being fun after a while, and little consideration was given to how different weapons match up. They should have had Sakurai direct.

The art style and music are great and the motion controls work wonderfully. I started off using the stick to aim, but the motion controls are much faster and more accurate.

Playing in ranked mode should help more since you're placed with players who are at your skill level, but higher skill playing is more tedious than fun. On stages with tight choke points, you'll spend the full match tiptoeing around snipers, for example. I got to A- rank and started to feel that improving was becoming less fun.

story #spoiler this game is about lara and her friends just as the trailer shows she was searching for a artifact that in a island but got trap in a storm before they find out that it wasn't a normal storm its from a storm god and survivors that is trap in that island started to worship it bcuz they felt like that island is curse once the ship crashed and wrecked and landed on the island everyone blamed lara because they wouldn't be in this situation bcuz of her blah blah blah long story abunch of pointless characters thats friends with lara dies in the story plot they try to get connect for rescue that fails and the most annoying character name sam gets kidnapped so they can transfer the storm god into sam body lara stops it in time and killing some guy that they met after that landed into the island bcuz it tuns out he was one of the insane survivors that was trap in the island - the end

The good:

Interesting character creation
Combat is fun, snappy, and responsive (But is mouse targeting REALLY different than hitting tab?)
Gorgeous world.

The bad:

Elitist playerbase.
GvG (It's fun hunting a level 1 guild leader..)
The empty world
The quest system (ENJOY GRINDING JUST LIKE AION!)
Elin race of little girls, that you frequently hear /local talking about in a profane manner.
and much, MUCH more.

TERA falls flat on it's face after getting out of the gates, the combat is very fun (Until you are killing your 8348234th monster using the same tactics as the previous 8348233). Big ass monsters are fun, and require strategy (However, this is very easy and the game boils down to how good a tank can tank, a healer can heal, and a dps can keep up dps.) The game sticks with the ""holy trinity"" of Tank, heals, dps and ensures a continued stagnation of the MMO genre.

Most of what I've played in TERA (All CBTs, 2 months since release)hasn't been all bad, I had fun leveling somewhat (the grind sucks).

THERE IS NO REAL ENDGAME! Unless you really enjoy doing the same 8 dungeons with HORRIBLE groups (unless you're in a guild, or better yet the popularity contest winning Vanarchy guild that controls a region) Ganking lowbies, spouting rubbish into the chat system, and generally being completely annoying when a new player asks a question is key with the playerbase here.

EDIT: EME has made some changes to the US TERA recently and are releasing PVP battlegrounds shortly. The GVG kill swapping has been stopped (lol) and new things are on the horizon, however these are too little and too late for this player. I just wish they'd stop sending me emails every 3 days about their game that I no longer have a desire to play. A current glance at how the game is doing in Korea is a direct indication of how the future of TERA in the west will be. 4 servers left, and nothing but cash shop items and little to no end game content.

Do yourselves a favor and look into Guild Wars 2!

Ever since EA Sports bought the exclusive rights to the NFL License, Madden NFL hasn't changed much except for the usual roster updates, slightly more polished graphics, etc. I wish that Sega Sports could still make NFL games because the NFL 2K series was the best football sim around. I would even rather play an old NFL Gameday (Sony CEA) rather than this overrated pile. Back in 1997, Madden NFL 98 lost in sales to NFL Gameday 98 because it was inferior. The next year EA Sports improved and went back to being the #1 selling NFL game. Then in 1999, Sega Sports released the breakthrough NFL 2K which destroyed Madden NFL 2000 gameplay and graphics wise. EA Sports hasn't made a Madden NFL as good as NFL 2K EVER, although they have always out sold Sega Sports NFL 2K because of better name recognition/marketing. I hope that Electronic Arts exclusive NFL License ends soon in the next few years because Madden needs competition like NFL 2K and NFL Gameday to stay fresh!

Anyway about this game: EA Sports must have lost all inspiration for making a new Madden NFL game every year, because this game simply feels stale. The graphics are clean and smooth for the most part, but the gameplay feels really slow and the controls are stiff and unintuitive. Controls are the worst for kicking field goals/punt/kick offs.

The only needing 1 CD for a 3D game in this day and age should have turned me off of the idea (Pharaoh only needed 1 CD too) but instead I pushed ahead with it.

In NO WAY does this resemble any of the famous predecessor games, Caesar III or Pharaoh or Zeus-Master of Olympus.

For one part, the user interface is abysmally clunky, with building options opening up from the side, crowding up much of the screen, and needing to be clicked AGAIN in order to close it up.  Building placement is awkward, and roads are seemingly useless, as it doesn't matter where you place buildings, because people will reach them regardless.

Next, immigration.  Rather than simply building housing for your people, you have to build INDIVIDUAL buildings, which house only one working man, his wife and single child.  Also, you have to build the houses for shopkeepers, as they apparently work out of the home, and have to constantly build new ones to add variety to every area of your city.

All other buildings save these require bricks to be built, so you must build a brickmaker AND a bricklayer (both act as houses and work areas) and the game itself even admits that bricklayers are lazy and won't deliver bricks anywhere unless it's close by!  Thus, you have to build brickmakers and layers almost everywhere.

All in all, everything else is a mess involving just building buildings, with production constantly stalled by lazy bricklayers, and very difficult to understand controls (unlike Pharaoh and the others, there is no advisors page which helps guide you around the constructing of a functioning city rather than a mere village.  The large building size also means that cities will be very small and unimpressive (my tutorial city in ""Pharaoh"" was over 2000 citizens large to function well, whereas my tutorial city in ""Children of the Nile"" had less than fifty!)

Watching the little people walk around is utterly pointless and boring

Made even worse is that the more advanced buildings (such as temples and the like) require educated priests trained at a school, and just getting a single priest to come to the city to work at the school is a hassle!  Even then, they have insanely important tasks to perform rather than teach, such as dealing with medicine and hospitals, courting the Gods, etc!

All in all, a very terrible, uninvolving, uninteresting game.  Total failure","Lousy half-baked 3D city-builder.  ""Pharaoh""/""Cleopatra"" much MUCH better",1161648000,10,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

Honestly, it's the most gorgeous game I've ever seen to date. At the same time, probably the least fun to play of all of the games I've owned in years, which I can't even believe I'm saying.

As a game, I would have rather played Battlefront 2 for the PS2 - which I still own and just played a moment ago to see if I was crazy.  Turns out I'm not crazy, and neither are the many people who have written these negative reviews on the game.  There was so much hype and so many people who hoped for the best (like me) or prepared for the worst (unlike me)...  I am so disappointed. After 24 hours, I feel crushed and broken, and I feel like my money has been wasted.

As for the actual review, I will say that other than the ""Walker Assault"" mode, the rest of the game play seems to be a bore to me.  I had a lot of fun with the beta and thought there would be much, much more. OK, there are a few more maps and modes to play with, but as a solo guy with no roommates or family, and not really a strong community of PSN friends to join for these online game modes, it's just not the game for me. And before I get scolded for saying that, it is my fault because I knew it would be more online based.  I just assumed the game developers were being ""hush hush"" about any campaign modes that might be there.  I gambled and lost. My mistake.

The guns are fine. I don't mind them the way others do.  Being a Hero/Villain is fun.  But after an hour, I just want to go play another game.  Flying vehicles are cool....  but...  Why do I have to die to get out of a Tie Fighter/X-Wing, etc.?  Why can't we go to space? WHAT IS STAR WARS WITHOUT SPACE???  And don't tell me it's coming later in a downloadable map. I'll be even more upset if it comes later because that just tells me they could have released a game with space battles from the start, which actually may have made this game 1000x better by itself. (y'all really screwed that up IMO).  What a waste, Dice/EA.

In my opinion, this game is absolutely inferior to Star Wars Battlefront 2.  I would have been happier with a remastered Battlefront 2 for the PS4.

It truly breaks my heart to express such harsh criticism. Although this ""review"" is more of me complaining than actually reviewing the game, the truth of the matter is that there's not a single thing I can say that hasn't already been said here in the other reviews, over and over again.  It truly is a spectacle to see...  and nex-gen graphics with something we all love, in Star Wars.  But horrible for a video game. This would have been better as playable trailer for the new movies.  As a game, It's nothing at all like the teasers or behind-the-scenes videos/documentaries I've watched for the past 2 years. It's not even as good as Battlefront 2, in my opinion.  I'm disappointed and bored with the game after just one day.  If I can't get into the game and enjoy it right away, it's not for me.  But this is Star Wars.  I thought George Lucas was the only person who could screw it up.  Turns out Dice/EA have followed suit, making it an overpriced and underwhelming product. (Sorry guys - as much care as you put into it, it's not enough for me).

I plan to take it to a GameStop, or someplace similar, sometime in the next day or so and sell it used and take whatever financial hit it is.  After the horrible feeling from waiting 7 months since pre-order to get this game, I'm just over it.  It wasn't worth it at all.  Now it's time to get a different game that I really wanted (Fallout 4).  I have a feeling I'll enjoy that game a lot more.

Not exactly, file this one with Legend of Dragoon as a predictably unoriginal, mediocre RPG. If you're looking for that game that will pick up this slump of good software for the PS2, you'll have to wait even longer.
Now let me clarify this: I have not played Zelda 64 nor do I own a N64. I did not hear about how this was going to be a copycat of Zelda until I finished reading someone else's review a few minutes ago. That said, I still felt like I was playing a rather effortlessly made copy of it. For sheer curiosity, I tried Zelda at a friend's house. Even the grunts Link makes in-battle seems to be stolen from this game.
What is the gameplay like? For ""Zelda-virgins"" such as myself, it was pretty good at first. It was easy to jump into, and hard to put down for the first 5 hours or so. Good, until, after quite some time in the game, nothing really happens in the storyline (a Sony RPG trademark) and after hours upon hours of repetitive gameplay (yet another Sony RPG trademark), it failed to keep me within its grasps.
The graphics, while good, are nothing spectacular. They quickly get tiresome when you're in the same dungeon for 5 hours or more. Every level of the dungeons look the same, so if you have a high tolerance of environments as repetetive as the gameplay, you'll have no trouble there.
And here's another staple, the immense amount of typing errors, the third sign of a Sony RPG. While there isn't much text, it was enough to make me want to send money to Sony to buy a spell checker for the sake of pity.
Georama is almost innovative. It would be if Sim-City hadn't done this general idea first, and if it gave you more freedom. The villagers are very picky as to where their house should be placed. So picky that you'll wonder why Sony even bothered to let you build these villages at all.

I know that no game, except for possibly GTA4, could even come close to GTA3, but I still wanted ""more."" From what I read about this game, it seemed like a poor man's GTA3.

When I read that Driver 2 did not have a driving test, that gave me even more reason to want it.

GAMEPLAY

When I popped the game into my PS2, I immediately went into ""Free Ride"" mode so that I could get a feel for the controls and check out the scenery a bit. I didn't even move one inch when the cops were after me. Yes, that's right, I was STANDING STILL and the cops were on my b-u-t-t. If the cops are going to be on me like white on rice, I'd at least like to know WHY. I gave the cops no resistance, allowing them the chance to come up to the car and pull me out (like real cops would, and those in GTA3), but they thought it would be best to just keep ramming me!?!

Since this game lacks the Police Bribes and the Pay And Spray of GTA3, the only way I could get the cops off my tail and reduce my felony meter (the equivalent of GTA3's Wanted stars meter) was to hitail it out of there in the hopes that I could lose them. Even though the game promises that you can wipe your felony meter clean by getting out of your vehicle and carjacking another one, since you can't get out of the car and switch vehicles while being wanted/chased, there's no practical use of this ""feature.""

I decided to try the main ""Undercover"" mode, hoping that it would be better. The first mission was simple enough. Get from point A to point B. The first time I tried it I failed it because I didn't get to the place on time (I was going the wrong way from the start). Once I figured out that all I had to do was make two lefts then go right every chance I could, I got to the destination with time to spare. Mission 1 Passed! Perhaps this game WOULD get better ... until Mission 2, that is!

Mission 2 involves you having to follow another car. The problem is, unless you're (at most) two car lengths behind him, the game will say that you lost him and thus failed the mission ... even though his car is clearly visible on the screen! After attempting this mission three or four more times, only to get as far as around the corner, I had enough punishment and immediately decided to bring the game back to the store with my Mom's receipt to get a different game. ANY game would be better, even Barney The Dinosaur!

Not even cheats codes could help make this game playable. I used two Game Shark codes to unlock the in-game Invincibility and Immunity (no felony) cheats. However, neither of these would help with mission 2. The Infinite Time Game Shark code would not work, otherwise I *might* have had a chance of barely playing the game ... the key words there are ""might"" and ""barely.""

GRAPHICS

This game has the WORST graphics ever seen in a video game of any age. Pong and Pac-Man look high-tech compared to this.

There is more pop-up in Driver 2 than in a marathon of Pop-Up Video on VH-1. You look ahead and see an open piece of land. You plan to cut across that land in order to make the turn at a high speed without having to slow down (or just to take a shortcut). Just as you get within a car's length of that land, a building pops up out of nowhere. BAM! You crashed and damaged your car. Repeat indefinitely and you've got the graphics of Driver 2.

Both distinctions actually belong to Final Fantasy XI. As far as most fans seem to be concerned, it exists outside of Final Fantasy canon; sort of like how Mystic Quest was considered in the 90's.

So why bother reviewing Final Fantasy XI now, you might ask?

Practically, it's Square's first MMORPG and, if you remember, was developed in tandem with IX and X, possibly making it the last game Hironobu Sakaguchi (the Final Fantasy franchise patriarch) worked on during his tenure at SquareSoft. Years after its initial release, probably up until the release of Final Fantasy XIV, it was the dominant MMORPG in Japan and the most widely-played Japanese MMORPG in the world. And seeing as the next numbered entry in the series, Final Fantasy XII, is ubiquitously regarded as an offline MMORPG, it can't really be said that XI exists in isolation from the rest of the series anymore.

So, here we go.

~CHARACTERS~

-You.

Yes. You. The player. YOU are the main character of Final Fantasy XI. When you log in, you awaken in Vana'diel as a freelancing young adventurer trying to make a name and fortune for himself. As you explore more of Vana'diel, becoming stronger and earning prestige, you soon discover the full dark extent of your forthcoming trials. The Beastmen are mustering their forces once again, there are whispers of the Shadow Lord's resurrection, and no matter how hard you try, you are unable to persuade any of your real-life friends into spending their money on Final Fantasy XI and helping you. Soon your missions throughout Vana'diel are keeping you up until 5:30 am on a nightly basis, you've stopped shaving, and you're subsiding entirely on microwavable peanut satay. ""WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?!?!"", you shout whenever the sun peeks in through the window blinds. And now you're regularly telling your friends you can't hang out because you need to work on the novel but you know darn well you're just going to spend thirty minutes halfheartedly revising a paragraph before closing the window and playing Final Fantasy XI until it hurts to stand when you finally DO stand back up. Do you persevere and see your mission through, becoming a legendary hero worthy of saving the imaginary realm of Vana'diel? Or are you going to puss out and run, deciding planet Earth and the things you do there are more important to you? Only you can decide.

-Everyone Else.

The 499,999 or so other people playing Final Fantasy XI. Some of them include the creepy high-level player who follows around new players with female avatars, the desperate collector who spams ""[Scroll of Teleport-Vahzl] [Can I have it?] 5k"" in the shout channel every two minutes, the chain smoker who brbs after every battle, the high-level spawn camper who doesn't speak English and sneers at your efforts to negotiate with him, the raven-haired Elvaan with a name from Dragonball Z or Naruto, a hundred thousand men pretending to be girls, the casual racist, the guy who's just arrived home from getting wasted and passes out in the middle of a battle, the 45-year old single man playing a Galka, the boastful party member who catalogues his sexual conquests and seems to expect you to believe him, the kindhearted Tarutaru, the male/female couple who regularly gets into arguments and has extended I love you no I love you sessions over the linkshell channel, the cowardly Japanese player who drops out of the party and flees when a fight goes awry, the one actual female who plays online games to inflate her self-esteem, the strange Tarutaru with the jack o' lantern hat who's logged in and sitting in the exact same spot in Southern San d'Oria 24/7, and the one genuinely interesting and chilled-out stranger you duo with once and then never see again.

~The Setting~
Final Fantasy XI takes place in the land of Vana'diel, the most complex and diverse fictional world Square has ever created. Even though the game's graphics are showing their age, Vana'diel is still a dazzling place that eschews the more phantasmagoric excesses of contemporary JRPGs for a more down-to-earth aesthetic. You'll almost want to keep playing Final Fantasy XI just to explore more of its world.
Almost.

~The Story~

Beats me.

No, really. I have no idea what this game is about. There's a plot buried in Final Fantasy XI somewhere, but I didn't really pay attention to it. It was too difficult to keep track of. Though the game does have its share of cutscenes, they're obviously not going to be as prominent as they are in an offline Square RPG. The scenes pertaining to the overarching story are usually only activated during national missions, which are sets of quests exclusive to your character's affiliation with one of the three cities of Bastok, San d'Oria, and Windhurst. Since you usually need to gain about five levels between national missions, you're viewing cutscenes within days, or more likely, weeks of each other. By the time you accomplish your objective and trigger a cutscene, you've completely forgotten what the hell is going on and are unable to understand anything the NPCs are talking about. It also doesn't help that party and linkshell chatter are placed in the same dialogue box as the cutscene text, so you end up reading the story in between messages from your friends and allies bugging you about why you seem to be lagged out.

But the cutscenes aren't really that important. The average Final Fantasy XI player is much more concerned with objectives and rewards. The cutscenes and plot are once again what they were in the 8-bit days: garnish.

So... let's talk about the gameplay:

After choosing your race, gender, appearance, and home city, it's time to pick a job. Yes, Final Fantasy XI utilizes a variation of the famed Job system, and all your favorite Final Fantasy staples are there: Paladin, Dragoon, Summoner, Blue Mage, Scholar, Bard, and so on. (Currently there is a total of twenty-two jobs-- but as long as Square Enix can profit from the game, there could always be more updates.) Starting off, you are only given a choice of six: Warrior, Thief, Monk, Red Mage, White Mage, and Black Mage (the six character classes from the first Final Fantasy). All of the other jobs must be unlocked by completing quests that start becoming accessible when you reach level 30. You can change your character's Job at any time by speaking with the moogle in your personal Mog House.

After hitting level 18 and fulfilling a ""collect three totally unrelated enemy drops"" quest, you get the option of equipping a Support Job (subjob). This allows you to essentially junction a second Job to your main Job and benefit from its stats and special abilities. There are some limitations, however. Two-hour abilities and Merits do not cross over from sub to main. No matter how high a Job's independent level is, it is capped at half the level of your primary Job when set as a sub. And even when you have a set sub, only your main Job gains experience points. It should also be mentioned that Final Fantasy XI makes no distinction between the levels of your character and those of his Jobs. Switching out your level 32 Monk to try out the new Corsair Job you just unlocked puts your character back at level 1.

Isn't THAT neat?

Now that you've picked your job, it's time to go out and kill stuff. Enter Final Fantasy XI's battle system. This is the first Final Fantasy game in which the old turn-based combat system is altogether eliminated, and fights no longer take in a battle screen apart from the field map. What you do now is target an enemy and select the ""Attack"" command. Your character will draw his weapon, a rigorous battle tune will start playing, and the camera zooms in closer. An invisible ATB gauge starts filling up. Whenever it is maxed out, your character automatically raises his weapon (slowly and laboriously), and SLUNCH! brings it down upon his opponent's hapless skull. Then he stands around for ten seconds or so until the imaginary gauge refills. (Or you can move him around if you want-- but it rarely makes a difference.) Then he attacks again. Then he waits again. Then he attacks again. Then he waits again. Attack. Wait. Attack. Wait. Attack. Wait. Nice and simple. It's like the game automatically tapes down the X button so you don't have to! There are times when you can initiate auto attack, step out for a smoke or bathroom break, and return to find a dead beastie and a treasure chest (usually containing something worthless).

But there is more to combat than doing nothing, or course. There are a couple of other options on the table-- you can cast spells, which puts the attack/wait/attack/wait cycle on hold for the varying duration of the spellcasting process. There are Job Abilities, which are activated instantly, but have a cooldown times that can last anywhere from half a minute to two hours. Finally, there are Weapon Skills, which are XI's proxy for Limit Breaks, Trances, Overdrives, etc. These require Technical Points (TP) to activate, which are stocked whenever your character successfully inflicts damage through physical attacks. Weapon Skills can only be used after you have least 100 TP stocked, and doing so reduces your TP to zero. The attack damage increases with the amount of TP spent, and a maximum of 300 TP can be accrued.

Before we go on, some words about Final Fantasy XI's group battle dynamic. Each Job is designed to be an organ or limb of the greater organism of the party. Generally speaking, there are only four (or five) character classes in Final Fantasy XI: the Tank (decoy and meatshield), the Healer (self-explanatory), the Damage Dealer (offensive mages and melee), and the Buffer and Debuffer (strengthens the party and weakens enemies). Some reviews will accurately point out that there is a certain kind of elegance in watching the party's disparate skills working in tandem to blast a Brutal Sheep to hell. But being a participant in that system is like working a post at a factory conveyor belt. You're doing the same thing, hitting the same macro keys over and over and over again, until the monster dies or otherwise turns the tables and kills everyone. The game isn't really designed to let you do anything else. The strategy never changes.

As a Red Mage, my task was to cast Paralyze, Slow, Dia, and Bio (always in that order), use Cure when the designated healers were low on MP or having a hard time keeping up with multiple attacks, and sometimes chip in with melee blows (unless I was ordered by the organizers to stop blocking the damage dealers' line of fire). Once the monster died, the designated puller would run out of sight, disappear for a minute, and then come racing back with an angry monster at his heels. The party sprang to action. I held the ctrl key and started hitting macro numbers. Paralyze, Slow, Dia, Bio, auto attack, Cure. Soon the monster would die, and the puller would gallop off and return with another beastie for us to lynch. Paralyze, Slow, Dia, Bio, auto attack, Cure. Puller goes. Puller comes back with monster. Paralyze, Slow, Dia, Bio, auto attack, Cure. Monster dies. Five minute healing/bathroom/coffee break. Puller goes. Puller comes back with monster. Paralyze, Slow, Dia, Bio, auto attack, Cure. Puller goes. Puller brings monster. Paralyze, Slow, Dia, Bio, auto attack, Cure. Puller goes. Puller brings monster. Paralyze, Slow, Dia, Bio, auto attack, Cure. ""Boy, what fun I am having!"" I had to say to myself out loud to convince myself that I was having fun.

So basically, participating in Final Fantasy XI's combat system is almost as much fun as reading about Final Fantasy XI's combat system.

The experience of playing an MMORPG is a much more personal affair than running through your average console RPG, and even more than that of offline sandbox games like Elder Scrolls and Fallout 3, because of how your interactions with other living players frequently affects your progress. The Final Fantasy XI trip depends totally on the player; no two people will play the same game. I lasted a total of forty days, with a total play time of just under 75 hours. Over three solid days, and I barely put a dent in it. Most Final Fantasy XI regulars would respond by calling me impatient.

Final Fantasy XI is primitive and slow, and those are its better qualities. As somebody who started with the US release of Final Fantasy on the NES, I've always felt vaguely disappointed at the sequels' departure from it. Final Fantasy XI is the first one that feels like it was made specifically with the original 1987 game in mind. It's not only because the original six classes are back, and not just that the game's protagonist (you) is effectively mute for the first time in fifteen years, either. Like the original game, XI's story is about exploring a world and uncovering its secrets, instead of a FIGHT THE EMPIRE scenario or a group therapy session for a clique of world-saving neurotics. The game doesn't hold your hand and it never forcibly drags you from one objective (or plot point) to the next. Curative and healing items barely exist, and hitting 0 HP is a disaster instead of a temporary inconvenience. And, of course, Final Fantasy XI is as ruthlessly difficult and unforgiving as the 8-bit games. At times, even more so. Choosing your battles wisely is more important than ever.

Final Fantasy XI's pace is already notorious. Even the most diehard fans won't mince words on this-- the game is slow. And it's not just the sluggish combat, either. Everything takes forever. Before acquiring a chocobo license, airship pass, or Teleport spells, it can take you 30-40 minutes to run from one place to another on foot -- and that's if you're avoiding combat and not regularly getting jumped by orcs, goblins, yagudo, or quadavs. You have to wait for shops to open, wait for the best in-game day to craft items, and wait for people to buy your swag at the auction house. You sit around and wait for you HP/MP to recover when you hit the ""heal"" command, you wait for people to invite you into their parties, you wait for your party members to run off and get Signet, you wait for somebody to come and cast Raise on you when you die, you wait two hours to use your special ability again, you wait one hour (in real time) between the five feedings in the chocobo license subquest. It feels like 75% of the Final Fantasy XI experience is waiting for the Final Fantasy XI experience.

Accomplishing any goal in Final Fantasy XI is done in very small increments, and each step of your progress can take hours at a time. Every story mission requires being about five levels higher than you were during the previous mission, and if you're able to gain one level for every two hours of playtime, consider yourself fortunate. (I've read horror stories: /SHOUT PLZ SOMEONE HELP ME I'VE BEEN LV 55 FOR A MONTH.) After every three to five levels you gain, your equipment becomes obsolete and must be replaced. Scraping together the funds for new gear requires spending a few hours crafting materials, farming crystals, or redoing a bunch of ""collect X number of enemy drop item Y"" quests. And when you're finally ready to do the mission, you must spend however much time finding and convincing other players to help you out. Some people find this exceptionally easy (though I've come to suspect that largely boils down to having the right job/subjob combo). I did not.

Final Fantasy XI is a game that demands a great deal of time, patience, and dedication from its players, and apparently some people love this. They enjoy the challenge; they appreciate a game that doesn't just open up its legs and give up everything it has to offer within five hours of playtime. Some people even enjoy the game's leisurely (now I'm mincing words) pace, as it makes Vana'diel more realistic and immersive.

The problem, of course, is that none of this is actually fun. During your stay in Vana'diel, you are constantly level grinding, crystal harvesting, doing NPCs' fetch quests, and spawn camping like you're on somebody's imaginary payroll. You have to take the same approach to Final Fantasy XI as you would a personal project such as building a model ship in a bottle, taking a martial arts class, or writing a villanelle. It is an arduous, time-devouring, and often frustrating process.

Exploring Vana'diel is a thrilling experience. Indeed. On the rare occasions you're actually exploring, anyway. Most of the time, you're spawn camping and level grinding on the same map for hours on end. Depending on how often you play and how much focused time you spend on leveling up and keeping your character's equipment and spells up to date, it can be anywhere from a few days to a few weeks before your character can cross over into a new zone without fearing swift evisceration at the hands of the first gob you encounter. Until then, you're stuck running back and forth between your home point and the local EXP party hotspot until you put in enough time to become sufficiently leveled up to move on -- on to the next EXP party hotspot.

The exploration and adventure aspects of Final Fantasy XI are irreparably damaged by a pair of clashing mechanics. Either one of these two mechanics considered individually-- as they were probably conceived-- is perfectly legitimate and makes a lot of sense. But it's not long into the game before they overlap, and playing Final Fantasy XI becomes a recreational chore.

1.) A: Characters lose EXP when they die.

Whenever your HP drops to zero, you lose experience points -- 10% of your TNL (to next level) mark, to be exact. (So if you need a total of 10,000 EXP to hit your next level, you lose 1,000.) If this makes your EXP points drop below zero, you drop down a level. Sadistic? Maybe. But let's play devil's advocate for a moment. Ever since it became standard JRPG design procedure to carpet bomb dungeon maps with save points, there's been virtually no incentive to play a Final Fantasy game (or most other RPGs for that matter) well. If you see a Game Over screen, you reload and are back at you were in five minutes (give or take an unskippable cutscene). Punishing players for being reckless or foolish -- for not playing the game well -- isn't something we see very often in the more forgiving post-SNES Final Fantasy titles. Still, having to spend 15-60 minutes dragging your character from his Home Point back to where he was before could be punishment enough in itself -- especially since it was, after all, the main deterrent from playing carelessly during a dungeon dive or boss fight in the NES Final Fantasy games.

2.) B: You must be in a party to get anything accomplished

Final Fantasy XI's designers wanted to make a game that encouraged interaction and cooperation between players. The most straightforward way of ensuring that players link up is to fix the system so that individual player is almost helpless on his own. There are a couple of Job/Sub combinations that seem get around this rule (Ninja and Dancer are commonly involved), but for the most part, going anywhere without at least two other people is suicide.

3.) A + B = BORK

The result? You have an online adventure game in which nobody ever wants to adventure. You're stuck grinding with everybody else, whether you want to or not, because it's the only way you'll ever be able to get anywhere. Unless you're fortunate to bump into somebody with the exact same objective as you-- which (in my experience) is exceptionally rare-- you're stuck in EXP parties until you can grind yourself to a high enough level to solo your way through. It's a shame, because the most fun I had in Final Fantasy XI was during the first couple of weeks when I was doing missions with three or four-player parties of people around my own level. But once you hit a certain point -- level fifteen or so -- nobody wants to play the game this way. Not when there's a chance they might die and level down. Not when there's the chance that a somebody might make a mistake and get them killed, setting them back by hours. Not when they can gain EXP faster by spending the sixth night in a row beating up Pugils in a level-synched party in Qufim. The way an MMORPG is played is determined just as much by the players as the designers, so both parties are at fault here. The designers wanted to make an immersive cooperative adventure game; losing EXP for losing battles was just another means of giving players a more personal stake in an enveloping game world. The players responded to this by creating a culture of standardized EXP parties and becoming a horde of insular cowards, undermining the entire ""adventure"" aspect for which the game world was presumably created. Nobody wins here.

The last day I played, I had to do a mission in Davoi. After doing a player search, I discovered a level 21 Summoner (I was level 22) looking for a party. He agreed to come over and help me out -- but before he did, he stopped by Selbina to switch his Job to a level 68 Warrior so he could power me through Davoi at no risk to himself. It was immensely generous, and I greatly appreciated the gesture, but at the same time it totally defeated the fun and the purpose of playing a game like this. He's not having fun because he's babysitting a pleading noob and getting nothing in return; I'm not having fun because I'm feeling rushed for using up this guy's time, and having a high-level player do all the dirty work for you is boring. Asking him to come as his level 21 Summoner or to synch his level 68 Warrior with my level 22 Red Mage would have been out of the question. It probably wouldn't even have processed. ""Take risks? Go on a run where there's a chance of something unexpected happening? Why would anybody want to do that in an adventure game?""

If nothing else, Final Fantasy XI gives me yet another thing for which I can blame .hack: impressing upon me a romanticized notion of what MMORPG player communities are like. The anime prelude to the PS2 games, .hack//SIGN, portrays a small group of MMORPG players of different ages, occupations, and walks of life being brought together through an online videogame. Watching //SIGN, you'd think that all the grinding, dungeon crawls, item harvests, and raids are less important as parts of a video game than for their being vehicles for communication and interaction between people. You laugh, you cry, you slay monsters, you gain levels, and you make real, enduring friendships that sometimes cross over into your offline life.

If Final Fantasy XI is any indication, this isn't an exaggeration. It's actually altogether false. Unless you can find yourself a particularly good linkshell (that's Squeenixspeak for ""guild"") or are able to find at least five personal friends or acquaintances willing to dedicate themselves to Final Fantasy XI, your interactions with other players will rarely be interesting or even that much fun. The vast majority of Final Fantasy XI players I've met are all business, all the time. Most of the strangers I met and partied up with were uninterested in chit-chat. When they did talk, 80% of the time it was about something directly related to Final Fantasy XI. 17% of the time it was something indirectly related to Final Fantasy XI. Stuff like ""[Congratulations!]"" ""brb bio,"" ""brb smoke,"" ""brb microwaev food,"" and ""god ???? u all this pt sukcs"" constitutes the remaining three percent. I can think of only three distinct occasions when a party or linkshell conversation unrelated to skill caps, experience points, the merits of a certain sub, or auction house wares sustained itself for longer than five minutes.

""What do you expect, fool?"" you might be saying. ""You're playing an online Final Fantasy game and expect players not to talk about Final Fantasy most of the time?"" Point taken. But when you're playing a game that involves so much sitting around and waiting for things to happen, it'd be nice to have players willing to shoot the breeze about -- well, anything else. But they don't. All they're interested in talking about is Final Fantasy XI. This is because they spend all of their free time playing Final Fantasy XI, since Final Fantasy XI isn't a game in which you can get ahead by concerning yourself with frivolous matters like outside interests and friends.

This player culture can be encapsulated in two words: EXP party. It's simple. You have an MMORPG that functions like an 8-bit JRPG. You need to do a lot of grinding in order to get anywhere, but player characters are individually too weak to run around and win fights on their own. The solution that Final Fantasy XI's players contrived is the EXP party, which has become an inextricable part of the Final Fantasy XI experience. If you're leaving a city or joining up with people, it's almost always to participate in an EXP party.

Essentially, the EXP party is a premeditated spawn camping session. In brief: you flag yourself as looking for a party, sit down in a town or at a field outpost, and wait. The length of your wait depends on your Job/Sub. Expect it to be short if you're a White Mage, but if you'd better keep a Spider Solitaire window open if you're playing something like Thief. Once the party's assembled, it moves to a select location close to where certain monsters spawn, but tucked away in a spot that aggressive monsters don't usually wander. Once everyone's in place, the slaughter begins.

And then there is the friendly reminder from SquareEnix not to neglect your friends, family, school, or work while playing this game. Anyone who has actually played Final Fantasy XI for more than a few weeks will tell you this friendly reminder is hogwash. The game is designed to make you forget about your friends, your family, your school, your work, and your life outside of Vana'diel.

Understand that this isn't a game you can sit down and play for twenty minutes after dinner at night, or for the hour you have between classes. There is no point in playing for an hour. An hour is how long it takes to log on, check your Mog House delivery box, peruse the auction house, hit up a special NPC to cast Signet on you, start or join a party, and walk halfway to wherever you're trying to go. If you can only play Final Fantasy XI for an hour at a time, you're better off not playing at all.

It's not even a game you can only play every few days, either. You need to play it frequently. Gotta keep up with the people from your friends list and linkshell. If you stop playing for a few days and log back on, everyone you know is suddenly five levels higher than you, halfway across Vana'diel, and unable to fit you into their itinerary for at least another couple hours. Might as well just solo until then -- solo and get killed by a Battering Ram, drop down a level, and fail to get anyone to come out and cast Raise on you because they're all halfway across Vana'diel and it's your own damn fault for not keeping up.

I can't figure it out. I'm pulling at my hair trying to think of a real redeeming quality possessed by Final Fantasy XI. Is the game an entertaining diversion? No, not really -- it's too great a time devourer. It's a ""diversion"" in the same way a second job or an emotionally needy long-distance girlfriend might be referred to as such. Are the battle and character customization systems what carry the game? Not really -- combat is slower than molasses, and the Job/Subjob setup is a drag, especially in light of how many hoops the game expects you to jump though in order to unlock new jobs and level them up until they become viable. Does it give the player any new ideas to think about? No -- unless we're talking about how it might inadvertently trigger OH MY GOD IS THIS ALL THERE IS TO LIFE existential crises in frequent players. Is the community of players what makes the game worthwhile? No -- not unless you're stimulated by people who communicate almost entirely in MMO abbreviations and are uninterested in discussing subjects that can't be articulated through MMO abbreviations. Does sitting alone and entering a level-grinding trance night after night for a period of months or years enrich your life in any way? No. It does not.

Final Fantasy XI is a useless game. If our lawmakers wanted to be consistent, they'd outlaw video games like this on the same professed grounds as marijuana prohibition. Chronic use of Final Fantasy XI will make you dull, reclusive, unmotivated, unthoughtful, and detached from reality -- and unlike cannabis, it isn't even fun. And that, for a video game, is the greatest crime of all.",Chasing the Dragon.,1478736000,,,

This has to be the BIGGEST disappointment I have personally EVER had as a video game player/owner.  I had such monumental high hopes for it and it fell flat on EVERY level.

#1 - Possibly the worst Create-A-Wrestler ever!  Costumes, colors, faces, masks, are extremely limited (or else so goofy you'd never want to use them).  Games for the PSX and N64 completely dominate the pitful options here.  Forget trying to make any ECW, WCW, or super-hero characters!  You're limited to three skin colors and only 9 color options for clothing (no text additions on shirts either).
#2 - Limited match options!  NO CAGE MATCH!  NO ROYAL RUMBLE!  NO SURVIVOR SERIES!  NO BLOOD!  NO LUMBERJACK!  Come on!!!!  Games like Warzone and Attitude for the PSX even had these options!  And correct me if I'm wrong, weren't some of these options supposedly offered when the game was being previewed?
#3 - Confusing game play!  Although the moves and fighting style are nice, the camera angle shifts WAY too often to allow you to stay focused.
#4 - Music and Save options!  Compare this game to the other Xbox offerings like Gotham City Racing (for the music) or Halo (for save and game options) and you'll be crying in your soup.  On a hard drive the size of the Xbox this game actually limits you in saving CAW and match options!  LIMITS the size of 16 wrestlers!  PHAW!

118250,1.0,False,"04 30, 2008",AHNHLGKIZ2N3B,B000VNS9D6,D. R. Jeanclerc,"The series ""Lost"" is one of the finest in television history.  However, the tie-in products never fail to underwhelm.

The makers of ""Lost: Via Domus"" faced a nearly impossible task:  create a story-based game that fits credibly into a show that's already got three seasons under its belt and that comes to a decent conclusion even though the show won't end for several more years.  Unfortunately, not only did Ubisoft Montreal flub this one, they also forgot the basics of making an interesting and enjoyable video game.

You play as a passenger on flight 815 who suffers from amnesia after the crash.  You meet with characters from the show and travel to island locales while trying to piece together your past.  The interaction with other characters is very lock-step, i.e. you say this, they reply that.  This linear pattern becomes an overwhelming attribute to the entire game to the point that you feel like you're watching a (very mediocre) episode rather than actually performing anything yourself.

Your memory comes back via dream sequences where you have to ""photograph"" select elements to unlock new information.  As meager as that sounded, I've just made it sound like more fun than it even is.  You replay the same looped dream over and over again trying to balance framing and focus to get just the shot that it's looking for.  This element of gameplay alternates between bland and flat-out tedious.

In between these revelation sequences, you go on simple quests that involve familiar show elements such as the hatch, the Black Rock, the Others, etc.  Again, it's all very linear stuff - go there, get that item, bring it back here, etc.  There are holes in the script that allow you to break out of this sequence, but you still end up getting handcuffed by the game anyway.  For instance, you collect coconuts (suddenly it's Gilligan's Island) and other island goodies to trade for useful wares.  I bucked the system and saved up enough to get a gun from Sawyer earlier than the developers intended, but was then completely unable to use it until much later in the game when it was necessary for the story.  But this led to ridiculous situations in the meantime - for example, if I'm carrying a loaded gun, why would I allow myself to be put into a holding cell and stripped of all my possessions?  There should at least be options for how to handle situations, but there aren't.  This also reduces replayability to zero.

The graphics are generally very good and the facial models of familiar characters are well-done, even if their movements are a bit robotic.  Voice talent is provided from many of the show's actors, but the ones who are substitutes really stick out - particularly Sawyer, who sounds like a cross between Ross Perot and Yosemite Sam.

I bought it mostly because I do multiplayer online with friends and since they got rid of their xbox 360s, I needed to get a One if I wanted to play with them. There are many other reviews out there, but here are my thoughts:
Pros:
it looks good, the controller feels good
the DVR feature is kind of cool
voice commands are nice
has separate optical out which I use with my astro gaming box/headphones
the kinect is fun and seems to work (haven't played with it too much aside from just dance)
blu-ray player - haven't tried it out but I'm sure it will work

Cons - this is at time of writing:
the menu system is confusing as heck to put it nicely. it is not intuitive and there are some spots where it doesn't matter what buttons you press, you can't go to the previous screen you were on. one time i went to upload and it took me to where i was at previously and I wanted to go to my clips. i tried every button with no success. but then i figured it out. i clicked on a random video and gave it a rating then it took me to the ""home"" screen in Upload. it shouldn't be that cryptic
voice controls are nice, but they don't always work. if you're listening to music you pretty much won't be able to tell xbox next song, because music is playing.
in game dvr is slow, very slow and the quality seems very poor. cool feature, but would be cooler if it was HD like the xbox One
no battery meter on controller - i've had this thing die on me in the middle of games. it's very annoying because there is no feature that tells you what battery life is
i've had issues with voice chat where i have to turn off the system then back on for my party to hear me. oh, and it doesn't default to party chat
it takes more clicks to see what friends are online, too many clicks (this is more UI issue)
it doesn't work well with my wifi (keeps losing signal <20 ft away). it could be my wifi , or this unit. i have no problems with my TVs, printer, computers and phones that connect to wifi, just the xbox

I think most of these issues will be fixed with an OS update, but it was poorly layed out. Because of where it's at today (i hear there should be a UI update soon), I can't recommend this system. I've had the amazon return window open the last day, debating on whether i should return it or not. If you have a 360 and you're looking for something better and only that, then keep your 360. if all your friends have it, well, make the plunge. xbox would be wise to make the UI better. i really really hope they do it soon",If my friends didn't buy it I wouldn't have bought it,1389398400,35,,

I've been playing all types of shooters, such as, Resistance 2, Killzone 2, Modern Warfare 2, Bioshock 1&2, Borderlands, and Bad Company 2. The reason I didn't pick up MAG on release date is because I heard alot of bad press about it, so I waited when the price was just right.

As for the game, the game was not good whatsoever, I felt the controls were too tight, the graphics were terrible (Resistance 2 has better graphics), every gun felt the same, and why did Zipper (game developer) included friendly fire. My first hour of gameplay I died 5x by teammates (i was killed on purpose). Furthermore, you have to pick one faction in the game (sver, raven or valor). However, if you want to play with multiple factions at one time you'll need to pay 99 cents a month (outrageous).

I had my reservations about BC2, but once I started to experience the overall quality of the game I couldn't stop playing. What I like about Bad Company 2, it sets apart from the other shooter games I experienced, such as the destructive environments and the vehicle usage. The destructive environments is a nice touch, because when you want to shoot a member from the opposing team and he's hiding behind a tree, house or a brick wall you can throw a grenade, rocket launcher, or any other explosive to expose him to your teammates or take him out yourself. As for the vehicles, there are 15 different types of vehicles in total to choose from and it feels great when you can hop into one and drive it around. For example, you can drive a M3A3 Bradley tank or fly AN-64 Apache helicopter to take out the opposing team members.

Then I read a Midway Q&A session on IGN.com regarding the game, and almost every response Midway gave either consisted of ""No, this game will not feature that"" or ""We hope to include that in the next game!""

Missing a lot of things though it may be, Midway showed just how much fail is in this product when they spend an opportunity to hype it up by basically crapping all over it and all but telling us ""don't buy this yet---it's only the beta version of the sequel coming in four or ten years~!""

Then the game itself.  The graphics are good, but what game isn't these days?  You can't give a game a pretty rating just for graphics alone---imagine how Final Fantasy: Spirits Unleashed would have been received if the graphics of the movie were considered a part of how good it was.

Even then, the graphics look nowhere near as good as the now-apparent pre-rendered screenshots plastered across the internet.  I absolutely could not tell that James Storm character was supposed to be James Storm, while for the most part, all the wrestlers look how they're supposed to, but don't break the barrier of shock and awe.  They are more in the league of Smackdown vs Raw 2007 or 2008.

That said, compensation appears to be made for the above-average graphics, by immense cuts in game content.  25 superstars is no real big deal.  When all those superstars have the exact same generic taunts and the same puddle of moves to pick from, THAT is a big deal.  A bad big deal.

The controls are a sloppy and contorted mess.  Arguably this could be from a several year-long accustomment to the controls in WWE games from Day of Reckoning to Smackdown vs Raw 2008, but either way, it's simply not very functional for the R button to be for running, and for the strong-grapple button to be on the opposite side of the controller from the base grapple button itself.

The controls are designed in such a way that it will take a very long time to grow accustomed to them, much less to master them.  Maybe this is due to my clumsiness and retard-fingers, but even I was able to get over the switch of L button for blocking strikes, R button for blocking grapples in SvR07 after a transition from WWE Day of Reckoning 2 (where it was the other way around) within a short while of gameplay.  As such, when you are thrust into the ring early on, your only chance of winning is the basic punch/kick/basic grapple until you can figure out how to do more complex maneuvers without the computer utterly destroying you while you stand around stupidly.

The moves actions in-game are indeed fluid, but only for as long as the opponent is standing.  As soon as they are knocked down and fail to immediately come back up, the fluidity is broken.  As far as I can tell, there is absolutely no way to pick your opponent up when they've fallen---only to stomp or punch them, drop elbows or whatever other thing, or do ground grapples involving the exact same arm locks and such.

The ""fluid"" motions as well must be fluid if you consider just how slowly they come about.  The controls do not react immediately, and once you've set about trying to perform a punch or a grapple, there is no going back.  As such, if you're lightning-fast on your button mashing like I am, you'll be angered to no end by how sloppily your character tries a meek little punch, only for the enemy to back away quickly, then come right back up and hit you while you're still recovering from throwing that first punch.

Midway apparently HAS reason to brag about how ""fluid"" their grapples are as well---there are only about two or three of them the player can perform!  Compared to the dozen or so that can be done in the WWE equivalent, the game pretty much only needs one button and two directions on the analog stick to fluidly perform the exact same suplex or jawbreaker or hurricanrana quickly and efficiently.

Counters are apparently the only area where the uniqueness of TNA's in-ring talent is on display.  Amazingly, the moves are all very ordinary and basic, whereas the counters show off some of the most insane, unique, and innovative maneuvers TNA wrestlers can do.  Counters.

The sound is terrible.  Obviously something like sound isn't really of big importance to a game that does it right, but in this game they've really done something wrong for sound to get mention.  The audience has only three or four noises they make---and they are NOISES, because this crowd never quiets down or gets louder---the generic white noise of screaming, a gasping sound effect used millions of times in various movies and TV shows for the past hundred years, and slightly noisier, but no more louder, cheering.  The punch/kick sounds are comical in nature, sounding like something you'd hear in Street Fighter II or Final Fight for SNES.

I COULD have given the game a two or even three star rating if not for the crux of the massive bag of issues this game is; the fact that the opponent will seemingly always be better than you no matter what, always.

I started the game playing as Chris Sabin vs Shark Boy, and in said match, I was very new and experienced.  I tried a balanced workout of punches and kicks first, followed by experimenting with grapples, and trying to figure out how to do other grapple moves.  Not only did I utterly fail to do anything but snap suplexes, but because I was kicking the crap out of Shark Boy with only the most basic of moves, he easily countered some of them, built up a full iMPACT! bar, and performed his finisher and pinned me for three.

The next match I was AJ Styles vs Rhino.  This bout went even shorter, as despite the fact that we both battled each other equally, my pins barely made two, whereas Rhino's one pin got me at 3 in less than 3 minutes.

Then I go to story mode, where the most damning thing happens:  I spend a good 15 minutes utterly destroying this obese clown named ""Benny"" or some generic name like that, with 80% of all strikes and moves in this match being done by me on him, and I grab him up in my finisher and pin him, and he kicks out.  After a more sustained and concentrated beating, not only does he kick out AGAIN, but he manages to pull off his finisher on ME and PIN ME FOR THREE!  After getting in almost NO offense, he somehow BEATS ME!

This happened THREE TIMES IN A ROW!  After finally beating him somehow, I move on, and THE SAME THING HAPPENS!  I squash my next opponent, and yet they perform enough moves on me (seven moves on me out of 6000 on him is still enough to get you a full iMPACT! bar) to perform his finisher and beat me.

UPDATE: This only seems to get worse as you progress in storyline, as bigger-name stars are even bigger jerkasses to beat, as in one scenario where I LITERALLY squashed James Storm (as in, got over 90% of the matches' offensive moves placed on him), and just because he managed to counter 10% of my moves, HE is able to get a finisher, hit it on me, and pin me for three.  Trying to break out of a pin by wiggling the control stick is such a frantic ordeal, I've cut the skin of my palm just trying to keep an opponent down for a pin by wiggling the control stick.  Or rather, smashing it back and forth wildly.

This is pure BS.  When you're pinned, the game gives you a motion of the analog stick wiggling back and forth in order to break the pin.  The only problem is it doesn't tell you WHICH analog stick this is, and ""wiggling it gently"" is as effective as not wiggling it at all---you have to ram it back and forth as fast as you can.

with multiplayer simply mashing buttons faster, rather that any form of actual technique, will always guarantee a win.

The other issue is simply that there is no AI. At the beginning of the single player arcade style games, the computer opponents just sit there until you knock them out which is about as exciting as staring at the wall. After beating a few dozen rounds the computer opponent improves a little, but then immediately after a few improved rounds, the computer opponents suddenly can move faster than you or anyone else can ever mash a button.

You can actually watch legs, weapons, and entire bodies of your player model passing through the computer opponents as you strike(no damage is caused of course, the same is not true of the computer opponent passing through the players character), the computer opponent can block at all times even while striking (the player can only strike or block, not both and there is a transition time between them), and the computer opponent can charge up all weapons in roughly one half the time the player can, and surprise! the computer opponent does between 10x-20x the damage the player can even with the computer doing the lamest misfiring hits. It appears they favored static scripts with very simply conditions to make the computer opponent succeed or fail, including outright cheating. Sad. So unless you're playing other people you're wasting your time and money.

Oh and i forgot to mention, the single player 'weaponmaster' mode (called so because it's certainly not story mode) is so boring and contrived that i honestly can not believe it's there. Par for the course...

But don't be fooled. Underneath the sunny exterior lies a sinister, insidious force that leaves you burnt to a crisp.

The graphics are gorgeous. Watching the first few cutscenes left me with a slack jaw, and the in-game graphics are head and shoulders above most everything else I've seen. Character models are incredibly vibrant, colors are bright, and everything seems bathed in a soft glow. If these visuals could somehow be transplanted into a completely different game, we might have something here.

The battle system earns a solid ""meh"". At least it's not the mess that we bore witness to in Star Ocean 3, but it's very mindless hack 'n slash. I just wish I had something more to do than mash the attack button!

As all RPG fans know, though, exploration, not battle, is the heart of this genre. In my opinion, a successful RPG must somehow get the player excited about exploring towns and talking to NPCs. However, this is the area in which RS emits an endless, unforgivable stream of greenhouse gases.

If you believe the PR, there is supposedly a real-time system that lets you recruit characters and complete sidequests as the day passes. But there are not nearly enough sidequests to do, and time passes veeeeery slowly...and the only way to fill it is with what I believe is the stupidest implementation of this generation: ""dueling"" the townsfolk.

In order to be of proper level to proceed, you must provoke NPCs into fighting you. The problem? Most of these NPCs are as strong, if not stronger, than a boss, and you must fight them without the aid of your allies. This is extremely frustrating. I felt conned; nowhere in any of the reviews or other coverage of this game was this mentioned.

Overall, RS made me feel stymied. Too much frustration, too little to do, and the added fact that you keep feeling like you ""should"" love it. Additionally, the game's much-touted humor seems like it was aimed at brain-damaged chimpanzees, although I admit that this is a matter of personal preference.

Seems more like a political indoctrination tool, or a bad movie about something I would never watch, than a game that is actually about the Mafia. Let alone a fun to play video game I would pay for.

Don't get me wrong here, the game plays after a very lengthy scan of the local data files. But all those ""in-game"" exclusives aren't on your character. You'll hit the [...] wesite and find that there aren't any useful support options. I recommend you do what I did and Google your problem.

Now I haven't even touched on how buggy half the game content is, and how broken the classes are. These aren't unique problems, like a bugged quest here or there. That kind of stuff is expected, no MMO escapes that. But this is a whole new level of bugs. For example, it is quite noted that the assassin's hide spell (stealth) is a 50/50 hit and miss affair. When I say hit and miss, I mean, you'll get all the fancy annimation and to the player you'll look hidden. The annoying fact, comes when you realize that the MOBS didn't get the memo...

If you're stealthed, you should not be detected in the same manner that you would be if you weren't ""stealthed"". A rogue that can't hide, that's like having a warrior that can't swing a sword.

It's now the reason I'm selling the console back. For some background, When I was 12-13 years old I played Halo: CE and here and there played Halo 2 with friends that owned the game. I spent maybe 15-20 hours on the original Halo games included in the MCC. Also, I did play the s*** out of Halo: Reach and it remains one of my favorite games to date. I had high expectations for the MCC because of Reach and have been severely disappointed.

As of 12/1/14:

* Multiplayer is screwed up. I've been able to get into 4 matches. One was 5v2, one 2v0, one 1v0. The last was actually 8v8 and it was fun, but I don't think I'd be playing it much. The red vs blue gives a very old vibe that is fairly boring.

* Graphics look good compared to the original games, but I expected a lot more. Compared to newer great looking games like Destiny, Assassins Creed (Black Flag... haven't tried Unity), and even The Last of Us, Halo graphics are kinda pathetic.

* Texturing... ugh. I've never thought I cared much about texturing until I played this game. Halo MCC looks sparse and bland, especially CE and 2.

* This might be a little controversial to some of you, but I do not care for the campaigns. Halo: Reach's story was absolutely amazing and I was totally engrossed in the probably 12 times I played through it. I feel almost bored going through CE, 2, 3, and 4 missions. Out of them all, I'm enjoying 2 and 3 the most.

* Playing with friends can be a frustrating experience when connecting with one another. Some kinks need to be worked out where if the party leader leaves a mission (or a multiplayer lobby), the rest of the group should too. There are lots of little problems like that. Also, it takes a long time for the friends list to even load and sometimes friends that I'm chatting with in a party (and are in game) do not appear on the list.

* I am not happy with the control setups available to me. I've been playing a good bit of Destiny and BF4, and going to Halo controls has been an annoying experience. I'd very much like to be able to assign my own controls how I like them if popular layouts aren't offered.

* Actual gunplay is frustrating. I like having a very precise reticle so I know exactly what I'm shooting at (mostly for headshots) and the reticles in Halo MCC aren't fulfilling. Other games, I usually kill with headshots 70% of the time in multiplayer and 80-90% in single player/coop. In Halo, single player/coop is probably around 20%.

I'm usually a skeptic so spending $60 on all this amazing content that was being advertised was pretty out-of-character and it should have been a red flag. I'll not make that mistake again. I will say that if you are a big fan of Halo, you'll probably eat this game up and love it. But for those of you who don't have an attachment to previous Halo games and are looking for current-gen quality, don't get your hopes up. If they fix the problems and the price goes down to $30ish, you should buy this game. But this game alone should not affect your decision between X1 and PS4.",I really wanted to like this game but it has been disappointing,1417392000,7,,

I received my Wii U and spent the next 5 hours trying to download the data for the update that's required before you can really do anything. I would receive errors after every 1-10 minutes of download time.  I even got on the nintendo support line and received an hour of help from one of their tech guys.  It took over four hours for the download to complete and then half an hour for it to install. Then, I thought my trials were over, but no! I go to play a game and - guess what? The system cannot read the disc. I try another disc. and another. and even the one that came with the system! Nothing! It cannot read any discs! This whole thing was a complete dud and totally unusable.  I decided to return it.

Now, onto more positive:  I went out the following day to buy a bundled Nintendo Wii U deluxe system from Target - it was actually CHEAPER than this Skylanders bundle and it's the deluxe version with a game I actually would play (Mario 3D world), not this Skylanders thing.  When I went to set  up the Deluxe Wii U, the upgrade download took about 5 minutes and it works perfectly.

This game is not complete yet. I strongly recommend avoiding it until Capcom finally gets their **** together. This game was quite clearly rushed and still has many issues.

As far as the gameplay, it's decent. My biggest beef with this is that it really lacks the fun factor of USF4. There were so many different types of combos you could do in that game where as in this it feels limited. Maybe I didn't go as deep into it, but oh well. First impressions are really big for me. Ultra Street Fighter 4's launch was bad, but not this bad. Due to the fact of the fight money system not working, Capcom I guess tried to redeem themselves by giving away the first DLC character for free. That alone will not excuse the awful launch (they beta tested the game's online for months and still had a piss-poor launch). I'm not going to excuse Capcom any longer. I'm totally done with SFV.

If it is to high its impossible to beat. I know what your thinking. "" play the game from lowest and bumb the difficulty slowly as you get better at it."" No you cant do that.

138807,1.0,True,"10 19, 2012",A2EW34CTJCU4GL,B00178630A,Weeping Rain,"I played Diablo 3 for around a week. I got all 5 classes past act 3; my best 2 characters (monk and witch doctor) got through normal difficulty.

=====  VISUAL  =====
The art style was cool to look at; it is one of the few 3d hash-and-slashes that I know of to go with a dark atmosphere, and the rocks in act 2 (desert, with black pointed rocks) were very stylish. I even got as far as to think that if the game keeps up the good artwork, it would be worthwhile to buy this game just to watch the artwork. But getting to act 3 (snow) and seeing the same rocks colored differently sunk all of my fantasies about the game's aesthetic value. The images are also a bit grainy; my guess is that the graininess is because Blizzard began designing the game around a decade ago, before we had today's screen resolution. The art style of acts 1 and 2 is about the only pro about the game.

=====  SERVER  =====
Given all of the connection issues (sometimes you can't connect), Error 3006 login issues (sometimes you connect, log in, and fall 1 step short of accessing your characters), and boss fight disconnects (sometimes you get disconnected during boss fights and reconnect as a corpse) already flooding the forums, I do not have much to say much about the server. (yes, Blizzard put me through all of them) The only things I have to add are:

1. While I was fighting solo to the final boss, I saw the message ""server will be down for maintenance in 15 minutes."" Just imagine that you fought so hard to finish the game, and failed because your SINGLE PLAYER server went down for maintenance!

2. I'm taking my time writing this review because Blizzard's server is down. Again.

=====  DIALOGUE  =====
You would think that, with all the time Blizzard invested into making Diablo 3, they will have plenty of time to polish the conversations. But instead, it seems that Blizzard ran out of audio/scripting funds from their long years of inactivity and had to cut the dialogue bank short. For most of the dialogues (including all of the quest dialogues), you have 1 set of NPC dialogues that fits all 5 classes, and each class works his/her dialogues around the NPCs'. The conversations are ok at times, but other times, it just feels like nobody's paying much attention to what the hero says. For example, take the following conversation between the Zoltun Kulle (a ghost) and your character:

If you play monk, you get:
Kulle: The Horadrim did all this to lock my body away. They must have been very angry with me.
Monk: They couldn't kill you. What else can they do?
Kulle: They were never very creative. (me: yeah, that sort of makes sense to me. So they aren't very creative about how to get rid of Kulle.)

And if you play witch doctor, you get:
Kulle: The Horadrim did all this to lock my body away. They must have been very angry with me.
Witch doctor: Are you surprised? Few people take betrayal lightly.
Kulle: They were never very creative. (me: huh?? what does taking betrayal harshly have to do with creativity? Kulle, ignoring me is not cool!)

=====  GAMEPLAY  =====
This is actually the biggest issue I have about the game. Diablo 3's enemy attacks for normal is divided into 2 categories: scratches... err...no, gentle touches, and nukes. And around 90% of the latter take the form of an unmoving circle that explodes after 1-2 seconds.

So gameplay (at least for normal) basically goes like this: you run around, squashing everything in your path, and getting blown into pieces because a few enemies cast circles under your feet. This is especially frustrating in acts 3 and 4, when even a type of normal minion can throw these attacks. It feels like the monster designers ran out of ideas and decided to throw bright circles in every act, hoping to get away with ""we're testing our players' reflex!""

=====  IS IT WORTH IT?  =====
Overall, I'm glad I got this game for $35. Is it worth it? No. It's worth $10 at best. But it's better than the pre-order price of $60. And it's one of those games which has such an epic predecessor that I simply had to try it despite its accumulative 2-stars. But after Diablo 3 leeched Diablo 2 of its fan base, I will be a lot less tempted to buy Diablo 4 should Blizzard decide to make it.
For those who wonder why I still put up with this, it's because I already invested $35 into it. And because I want to see if anything changes during late game (though I seriously doubt things will change).",Impressive Visual Style... at first.

Then the keys started rubbing off on top and you can see all the back lighting underneath (the stuff around the actual letters and numbers). Wow I can't believe it. I paid a lot for this keyboard and it is just horrible. The touch feature for turning off the lights is very poorly designed as well. I don't know how many times I have actually had to turn it back on in the dark and sliding my finger all over.

I went back to my Logitech G15, with the price this thing cost and how it was suppose to be high quality I am sorely disappointed. My Razer Lachesis review isn't much better than this one as well.

One extremely annoying new ""feature"" was the random battle encounter gauge. Unlike 2 where you would get a ""!"" above your head so that you could run away from a random battle,WA3 only lets you do this 10 times,then you HAVE to fight.
Another bad feature was the fact that everyone uses guns;you can hit with your fists(when your out of ammo)but it does such lame damage that it's not even worth trying. Also the personal skills system was changed for the worse(having to equip an item,fight so many battles and then having the item dissapear after you've learned the skill)
The characters and the story were also short of my expectations for the series. While janus & co.(bad guys) were sometimes funny and sometimes despicable,they were nowhere near as great as say liz & ard from part 2. The game also felt like it was TRYING to make a story just to give you a point to do things,whereas the previous two installments had great stories to them which also just happened to be games.
The only good thing about this game is the graphics;not the ahh and ooo 3D type,but the fact that all of the characters looked like they were hand painted with water colors,and that was impressive. The only noticable music in the game was the traditonal wild arms opening that's heard during the train scene after you play all four character intros. The very start was sung in voices with a hymn-like effect;very nice. Everything afterward is just hum drum,average run-of-the-mill.

As the series went on it was nearing its peek. meg man X was insanely good, great powerups, and o so much mroe to collect, as was X2, and especially the ultra rare, 125 dollar X3. The trnslation to the next gen consoles is usually the ultimate down fall of great side scrolling, old school shooter, and this is no exception. Megaman had some undoubtedly rough spots, what with megaman legends, and megaman 64, things were really looking down. Then capcom graced us with megaman X4, good ol' side scrolling fun, and megaman was good again for a brief shining moment. Then again the quality began to slip with X5 and 6, and X7 is definately the low point.
the problem with this game is that megaman was never meant to be a 3D expierience, it just doesnt work. The game has terrible controls, average graphics, and infuriates you past the point of caring anymore. Megaman should frusterate you, but before it fueled you to do better, now it just pisses you off and causes a lot of broken controllers.

My Lachesis has never worked 100%. Even after installing the most up to date drivers and firmware, the pointer will still skip up to the top of the screen. It seems to happen a lot when im using my right mouse button to move my game camera around.

The programibility and macro functions of this mouse are on par with any other gaming mouse, so nothing special there.

Ergonomics:

This mouse takes a while to get use to, the way you grip it is different then a typical mouse. Its by no means superior to a normal shaped mouse, and so the steep learning curve (many days) is truely a negative.

The button placement on the right side are such that they are next to useless.

Ease of use:

Out of the box you must go online to update the firmware/drivers.

You must make sure your mouse pad remains clean from lint and hair as this affects this mouse more so then other mice.

Conclusion:

Look im not saying this mouse is a useless piece of junk. What I am saying is this mouse was a huge waste of money.

From the tactical map allowing commands and control of all your men, this game really gave you the feel of being a battlefield commander.

With each new version of Ghost Recon it has become apparent that Ubisoft is no longer concerned with supporting the PC environment or it's users which is a real shame.  While I enjoy some console games, primarily sports, I've never enjoyed 3D shooters on console.  I like many of my friends prefer the mouse & keyboard as well as the beautifully rendered graphics.

While the 360 and HDTV eliminates one of these, I don't think it's enough to port a console game directly over to the PC.

Most important, I believe that the game play has been dumbed down to the run in, kill, get killed mentality.  Gone are the tactical & squad based maneuvering that really defined the original game.  That was something original that set this and the SWAT series apart from other 3D shooters.

No real single player (no EA, the waves-mode doesn't count), no community servers, no way to play with AI with friends, no space battles, mediocre unlocks when playing online, too few maps, too many empty game modes, and just no reason to play.

My biggest problem is this game will be unplayable soon, like actually truly unplayable, a trend that's becoming disturbing in the gaming world. On the PS4 the servers are still pretty active, it'll probably remain that way for a while, but the online experience is a barren wasteland on PC and Xbox one with either EXTREMELY long wait times to find a match, or, in my experience, absolutely no matches found on PC. It's been this way since release day, and for some reason PS4 is the only one that's survived.

My 1 star rating is for EA selling me a full-priced game with $20 of content that is dead on release for 2/3 major platforms, and not even seeming to care about it.

I don't ask for much EA, all they have to do is add AI play and let me invite friends who can come and go as they please. Let me choose what maps I want to play in what order and what game modes to do, don't make Titanfall and Battlefront a habit.","Zero content, already dead game on 2/3 major platforms (Xbox One and PC)",1468281600,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I really don't understand where they were going with the sims 3.

First of all, this game is not beginner friendly on My Career.  Shooting sucks at this game, so you might have a better chance at getting an open shot then actually making them.  True, an open shot doesn't always go in, but a majority of them should have gone in.  It's not the game itself it's hard to shoot the ball, but for whatever reason, 2K decided to remove the Rookie (very easy) and Pro (easy) difficulty setting, thus making the easiest difficulty, All-Star (medium), a nightmare for new-comers or for those not that experienced.  From playing 2K13, I can easily say that all the difficulty does is make your shot worse, and that's it.  Also, the tutorials really don't help.  They don't show you how the move is done, and you get a strange, loud ""NO"" if you did something wrong, like Lil Jon was teaching you how to play over the internet and just got frustrated.  It might sound goofy, but believe me, the game actually does this.

The AI has to be the dumbest I've ever encountered in any game.  They never take open shots, but instead, pass it back to you, even if you're out of bounds or not open, pass it to someone else, tries to drive it in, or just stand there with the ball.  They'll also make some crazy decisions, for example, Wade run from under the basket to the right side of the court, and going back and forth from there.  The shooting might make not turn you into a ball-hog, but the teammate AI won't turn you into a play-maker anytime soon.

The controls in NBA 2K13 were perfect in my opinion, just a little slippery at times, but in 2K14, controls aren't the best.  The controls really did not need to be ""improved"" with an ""intuitive Pro Stick,"" the right stick controls, and the right stick should only be for Iso moves.  You can change what the right stick controls, but it's still unnecessary for 2K to change the controls.  I even hated calling for a screen because it's the Circle button and not the R1 button, which I found more comfortable than using the Circle button.  It's still a bit slippery at times, and the controls could be just a matter of getting used to them, but this is one area 2K13 has an advantage on.

Another bad thing about the game is the soundtrack hand-picked by the cover boy, ""King James.""  I find it hard to enjoy a soundtrack that's filled with top hits like ""Blurred Lines,"" ""Who Do We Think We Are,"" and ""Can't Hold Us.""  It's not the fact that they're bad songs, but I don't feel like some of these songs belong in a basketball game.  I'm actually surprised Gunman Style, Taylor Swift, and Justin Beiber wasn't in there somewhere, because then the soundtrack will be really out of place.  There are a few songs I like, such as ""Now or Never,"" ""In the Air Tonight,"" ""Radioactive,"" and ""Clint Eastwood,"" but most of the songs are chart topping hits that I don't like, heard a million times, or just don't belong at all.  Please, somebody put Tech N9ne, Rittz, or Yelawolf in a 2K game.  I don't care as long as a song belongs in the game and gets me pumped up, not pumped ""faked.""  Sure, 2K13 had WAY too much Jay-Z, nobody can argue that since he was the executive producer, but I'll take that soundtrack over 2K14's any day of the week, 24/7.

Now let's talk about the very serious issues with the game.  The servers are horrendous.  It will take you 10-25 minutes for you to save a game to 2K's servers, if you're lucky.  When it doesn't save your game on the servers, you will be forced to play the same My Career game you played before, even if you said to ""No, I don't want to quit.""  Whoever programmed the game should be replaced, because I noticed that when I changed through the camera settings, it did not save the camera settings, thus making me go through the same menus just to get the angle I want.  (Oh, and I don't why, but 2K loves putting stuff on the right stick, including the some of the menus.)  There's also a bit of a delay when wanting to skip some stuff, like the intro which took a lot of taps of the X button just to skip (and that intro is kinda cheesy, if I do say so myself.)  It just terrible on the programming.

Recommendation: Unless if you're a pro at the game who didn't get a Xbox One or PS4, do not buy!  It's not beginner friendly, the things 2K took out were more important than they thought, and it's really an abysmal game overall.  It's unfortunate since I wanted a basketball game to hold me over until I go next gen, and now, I'm calling the game a skip or a next gen buy, at least next gen has features that matter.",The WORST NBA 2K Ever,1390089600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Instead of supporting the stupidity of large corporate gaming companies that are ok with causing as much hassle/frustration as they can get away with, it's time to switch to indie games made by other gamers that actually will let you play their games. I should have saved my money for Torchlight 2.

The servers now at least usually let me in, but I've had lag which will get you killed quick. If you pause the game too long, they will boot you and you lose progress from the last save point.

181536,1.0,True,"02 16, 2010",AP6ZR3DA2IR78,B001NX6GBK,Stephanus,"Dante's Inferno is one of my favorite classical pieces of literature.  Because of its classic nature, I expect classic treatment.  I can see where many of the monsters based on the seven sins were given a modern treatment; it is certainly a well used inspiration for art, photography and the like.  If I were to design the game, I would have given it a more classic treatment, much like Gustav Dore'.  Nonetheless, the game has some interesting visual aspects, and to be clear, are very adult in nature.  This is no child's game.  It deals with Hell and all the deadly sins, and the vision of Hell with all of its trapped souls, mutilated, burned, crushed, and so on is certainly a vision to behold.  The visual aspect of the game I enjoyed.

Why do I not like this game?  Perhaps, I was expecting too much.  First of all, in my opinion, it is a total rip of God of War.  Game play is everything, and to be candid, there were no surprises.  After several levels, it began to become repetitive, and after dispatching the attacking minions of Hell, it all became too easy.  Once you figure out how to absolve or punish them, it all became too easy.  There is a lot of jumping and leaping around, and as the title of this review says, jumping again. Then came the puzzles, which required excruciating timing, and that aspect of it began to become extraordinarily boring.

I have been playing games since 1981, I even worked at ATARI circa 1982, I also teach Game Project Management, Game Design and Software Development at the college I teach at.  A message to all of the Game Designers out there:  making something intensely complex and extremely difficult which requires the ability to get your character to accomplish tasks in a specific order with microsecond timing IS NOT GAME PLAY; it is a clear indication to me that since you could not make game play more interesting, well, let's just make it difficult and painful in place of logic, level design, characterization.  A colleague of mine says that if a game is too difficult to play, we should get our money back.  I would love to see the Developers of this game try to get out of Purgatorio with their kind of game logic.  The game is also very short.  Dante's Inferno is rich in history, allegory, characterization, such incredible and truly horrific creatures, and we can finish the game all in a matter of ten hours?  Part of the issue of game play is, is it replayable?  Dante's work is the kind of literature that requires not just reading, but re-reading to fully understand what is going on.  What we get is a High School outline from this game, or dare I say a graphic novel treatment?  This is why I have come to hate it: from my point of view, Dante is given short shrift, and is more an exploitation than  exploration of his work.

Well, I got through it, but I cannot recommend it, and I can't ask for my money back.  However, I can save you the trouble.  For me, it is ALL about gameplay, story, characterization, logic, level design.  No matter how visually stunning a game (or movie for that matter) may be, it has to be interesting, challenging (but not painfully so).  (P.S. - I have the same problem with Avatar).

As part of the game, there is supposed to be some free downloadable content in March, but I won't be downloading it, and I won't be playing it.  There is a trend with some games that require you to download new content for a price.  Look, I already paid about $60 for this puppy, then I have to download more content?  What does this indicate to me?  That the story is incomplete, that the game is incomplete, and it SHOWS.

I cannot recommend this game.  Save your money, and if you need a vision of Hell, read the book; it will be more entertaining and significantly more interesting.","Total Rip of God of War, Jumping & Leaping and Jumping (again)",1266278400,34,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

It was HOURS from the time I unwrapped the box to the time when I could actually PLAY it.  And the trouble never stopped. For weeks I stubbornly kept playing, in spite of system freezes, interminable delays between maps, and frustration with one of the damn dune buggies, which was terribly difficult to drive because the graphics kept jumping and stuttering (in spite of my pretty decent system, well above minimum requirements).  And all this for the single-player game?!?!

I would say that I was playing the game maybe 50% of the time I spent trying to play it.  The other 50% was spent waiting for a map to load, waiting for Steam to authenticate me, and rebooting my damn PC every damn time the game brought it to a screeching, frozen halt.

And then one day, I had an epiphany.  The game play was pretty good. The puzzles were pretty good. I really liked that gravity gun.  But it just wasn't worth the hassle.  And it certainly wasn't worth relinquishing control of my system to that invasive Steam app. So I stopped playing.  I uninstalled it. And I never looked back.  I've not even been tempted this year to reinstall it and see if maybe some of the early bugs have been worked out.

I'd give the game away or sell it, but I wouldn't wish it on anyone with whom I'm on speaking terms -- or even an unwitting stranger.  And I will NEVER, EVER buy another game that uses Steam or its ilk.

They have taken what could have been a good game and ruined it by not paying attention to some basic navigation problems. The cursor indicates that you can move in a direction by showing shoe prints when you hold the cursor over a hot spot. But in this game the hot spots are tiny or in a lot of cases missing. This makes something that should be simple, moving around the screens, very frustrating. In one screen after 5 minutes of searching I couldn't find any hot spots that would allow me to move forward into the market area, even though it was evident that it was where I needed to go. So I gave up and started randomly clicking in the screen, which eventually allowed me to move forward, but again, no hot spots to indicate where I could move to from that position. So more random clicking to try to get to one of the booths in the market. After having to do this to move several times the screen finally changed to show the market from a different angle and at that point I had navigational hot spots again. The tiny hot spots also caused a problem with figuring out what items I was supposed to pick up or look at. It caused me to miss several items in certain screens. And in a few cases the hot spot was completely off the item altogether, causing some confusion as to which item I was to pick up or look at. Another annoying problem was that often my character would stand right in front of what I needed to look at or touch. So I had to keep clicking the screen around her to try to move her out of the way in order to get to the item in question.

First of all it deserves all the criticism about racism and obscenity.  This game is not for kids, or anyone who is fairly normal psychologically.  If you're into endless cursing, blatant sex acts, and cruelty to animals, then this game is for you.  Now for the game play, if you're still interested.
The game has Auto right in the title.  The cars handle nicely, better than Forza in fact.  The big problem is that this car game can't keep track of your car!  That's right, you do an activity and your car disappears.  You go into a guy's house, come out, and that car is gone.  There is no good way to collect cars, like in Saint's Row.  The map is rudimentary.  You can't bring up the map and move around on it, like in real games.  You get a static map with little blobs that are supposed to be locations of interest.  99% of these locations are clothing stores, barber shops, or gun stores.  The jobs that you're supposed to do show up as ? marks.  You're supposed to know, somehow, if you've done that job or not or if it's' the one you decided not to do.  I guess Rockstar ran out of words.  Speaking of which; you get little hints onscreen every now and then.  If, like me, you don't  have an hdtv you won't be able to read them.  So helpful to see something that might say, ""If you want to something, press the little blob.""  I spent a lot of time online figuring out what these things were about.
You can fly planes, but they are tricky and not a lot of fun, due to having to be super careful not to move the controls too much - more like work.  There are boats, but the one I tried to use to flee the cops didn't work.  It was really fun to run through all those back yards, weaving and dodging, with the idea of using the lake as an escape, only to climb onto a speed boat and discover that Rockstar didn't want that.
The jobs that require using a gun are terrible due to the fact that the targeting mechanism has a tiny dot for aiming - tiny, miniscule, almost invisible.  I've played all the big shooters, both military and sci-fi and this is the worst I've ever seen.  You get a white dot the size of a pin head against a pale building or the sky and it just can't be seen.  The only weapon with a decent sight is the sniper rifle.
The jobs that you're supposed to do aren't too bad for Michael and Franklin, who live in the city.  They are just run of the mill criminals.  Trevor on the other hand, is a psycho, dirty, foul-mouthed, disgusting pig.  You'll want to take a shower after playing as him.  His idea of fun is running over deer or sniping at coyotes - and beating up or killing anyone who looks at him funny.  Where he lives there are very few cars to steal, so you'll spend a lot of time just walking around trying to find one.  Don't run too much; that's not allowed.  Unfortunately you are forced to play as him, the game locking out Michael and Franklin.  I tried driving over to the city to interact with them, but the game won't allow that.  You can drive over, but no jobs are available.  Rockstar Games doesn't believe in free will.  You play what they tell you to play.
If you start a job and don't like it, it isn't easy to get out of it.  You have to abandon the effort by driving 20 miles away, get killed and drop out, or restart the game.  Not very sophisticated.  One job requires you to shoot it out with a gang.  The game kept failing the mission because I wasn't killing them fast enough.  That was because I couldn't get the tiny pinhead dot onto them quickly enough.  Very frustrating.
My biggest problem is that there is no moral choice in the game.  You don't get to chose if you want to be scum. Rockstar demands that you be scum, so even if you ignore the poor mechanics of the game, it's still just a one dimensional, racist, violent, and ultimately boring piece of garbage.

Unfortunately, I had played a lot of other games so there was nothing to really try but Diablo 3. I had heard a lot of tall tales going around about people making big money off the RMAH (real money auction house) so I figured why not give it a try.

After a week of playing and getting to Inferno act 2... I can safely say this is one of the weirdest products foisted on the gaming community that I've ever seen. I say product, because D3 is more product than game. You surely know how casinos glitz up their slots and their decor to create constant stimulation...  Well, Diablo 3 is more like a casino than a videogame. The spell effects are big and over the top, the graphics dramatic and colorful. There's stimulation constantly. However there's no game.

Strategy-wise you don't really do anything. Either you have the appropriate gear and items to fight or you've run up against a wall and need to buy something extra in the auction house. This can be done with gold you earn playing the game... BUT... not when it matters.

The final run of the game is called Inferno. At this point you'll need millions of gold per gear piece by Act 2 or simply die in the game. And remember, as I said there's no strategy either way. Either you've bought enough gear, or you die. They were even thoughtful enough to add huge fees for dying in Inferno, to truly lock you in to using the auction house.

Now to make matters even worse for the poor soul playing the game normally, they added a real money auction house. Using this brilliant feature you can buy items for up to $250 to help you beat a game you already beat 3 times. Make sense? It shouldn't. The ""money for nothing"" greed surrounding this is reminiscent of the web craze called bitcoins. To clarify, everyone loses here except for the house and the early adopters. Because I started the game last week, I doubt I'll ever make more than a few dollars here and there on the auction house versus the thousands some have already made. And as the pyramid scheme gets less and less believable by the people willing to hold up the bottom, the whole thing will be utterly worthless. In short, the game currently resembles a money making scheme of the shadiest type more than a game.

It really makes me wonder what Blizzard is doing in the gaming business. I mean they are casino developers. That's a fact, they just do it in the virtual space.

As game developers they lack any concern whatsoever for the elements of the RPG experience. The storytelling is Saturday morning quality, which is being generous. Cartoons usually have themes and some plot development. This game does not; it just has the silly voice acting of cartoons.

This game lacks any attention to gameplay details. It's impossible to think of any fresh tactics to try playing this game, because you can't do any with the controls and design of it. You can whack away at the monster. You can use one of the few build selections that work at level 60. That's it, the rest is 99.9% stats. Anyone who says all ARPG or dungeon crawlers are this simple is crazy. It's the norm for there to be layers of options to your play choices in any game. This game doesn't have any layers because they want you to focus on buying the items and that's it.

So there you go. You have been warned, and probably chastised by many for even thinking about buying this game. But the choice is yours. If you do get it though, give some love to developers of games that care. Check out Guild Wars 2 or some indie games. You can't go wrong playing those thoughtfully developed games.",The graphics are nice. Then you realize the game is a scam.,1341619200,74,{'Format:': ' Computer Game'},

I am a LONG time gamer, I have lots of love for all genres especially JRPGs and I am fairly lenient on games. I try to find enjoyment in games that are simply un-enjoyable or have many issues. However I am sorry to say that Fable: The Lost Chapter brings a new definition to the term ""Garbage."" It is simply the worst game I have ever played in my entire life. Now I will tell you why:

Story - It blows. It is very disjointed and is hardly enjoyable. It is your very basic story about your family being killed and rising to become a hero to beat the evil. Nothing more, and nothing less. I'm fine with that, but the way the story presents itself is dreadful.

Voice Acting - Atrocious Crap. A 5 year old child could bring more emotion to characters than the people who did this. It is unbelievable in every sense of the word. The characters seems lifeless and the voice actors are annoying.

Music - Nothing memorable at all. I know you don't have Nobuo Uem, or Tsuyoshi Sekito but damn not one good track at all?

Gameplay - It's bad. You will essentially be button mashing the entire game with the exception of occasionally healing yourself or casting a lame animation spell. The good/bad system in the game is flawed beyond belief. I know that if you commit bad deeds you should be punished but this game FORCES you to be a good guy or else you will have to pay massive amounts of money which is simply impossible. The entire system is unnecessary if you can't choose.

Technical Issues - Loads of them. There is pop-in, screen tearing, freezing, and many other various glitches in the game. My favorite game of the current generation is bug ridden as well (The Last Remnant) but at least it had good VA, Story, Gameplay, and AMAZING music.

I know this is coming off as a HUGE rant and I don't mean to offend any of the Fable fans. However I was just extremely disappointed with this game after hearing just glowing impressions from them. I am just ashamed that I spent 12 dollars on this and I bought the 2nd one as well which I am just horrified to open.

I'm sorry Peter M, but if your other games are as bad as this one I will have to agree with your comment about you never making a good game. If you like WRPGs I would recommend that you borrow this from a friend or rent it first so you don't take a leap of faith like I did.

126330,1.0,False,"04 18, 2010",A2FTHCGH06O4Y5,B000ZK9QCS,Caraculiambro,"Seems like this game was deliberately programmed to infuriate me. It's one of those games where you get your butt kicked while you're learning, a sensation I've never treasured. How would you like if I sat you down to a board game you didn't know -- you ask, ""How is it played?"" and I respond, ""Uh, you'll more or less get the idea once I start attacking you!"" That's exactly how this game works. I hate losing while I'm learning.

Anyhow, here's some other things:

1. The way this game was marketed promised a lot of good ol' hack-and-slash action. Really, though, the lion's share of your time is spent doing timed puzzles, moving blocks around, pulling levers, turning cranks, etc. Lord, if I haven't had an a**full of these! I solve enough g.d. conundrums every day at work: I don't need a video game testing my intelligence. I want to be a guy with huge muscles who runs around slaying monsters with his awesome sword! Is that too much to ask!?

2. The actual adventures your guy goes through get mind-numbingly repetitive, even if you're playing through the game for just the first time. Nearly every encounter is based on the ""cage match"" paradigm: your character trips some sort of switch, whereupon some sort of of walls come up, and some sort of monsters continue spawning until you manage to trip another sort of switch, whereupon the walls come down and you are allowed to continue. Yawn.

3. You cannot control the camera at all, as you can in many games of this type. This is a shame, since there are some good visuals along the way. This drawback gets pretty infuriating in some of the puzzles where you need to move the camera around a bit to get a good sense of what you're looking at. Heck, even when it's not a question of a puzzle, the camera is awfully dumb about framing relevant elements. As a result of this, the game has a very restricted, cramped feel, since what you get depends not on what your character needs to see or logically would see (e.g., the ledges he's jumping from and to), but rather what the camera wants to do to best showcase the background art.

4. The ""easy mode"" really isn't . . . the monsters are easier to kill, but since nothing has been done about the timed puzzles and jumping challenges (i.e, the spike room, flying through the tunnels), they still manage to infuriate everybody.

5. The actual combat is exceedingly dull, although it may not look like it to somebody watching the game. (I frequently put this game on pause to get my algebra homework done).  Although there are a plethora of combos available, nearly all monsters -- including all boss monsters -- can be safely dispatched by simply pressing the same button over and over again.

6. This game has no business forcing you to go through a whole bunch of jumping and swinging challenges since its graphics and shading aren't good enough to tell where your character is (e.g., remember jumping behind Athena's bed?). Most of the time this is because the lighting source (and therefore the shadows) are illogical, so it's difficult to gauge distance and height. Consequently, success in the game's many jumping puzzles boils down to just a matter of luck and memorization, not skill. Also, the logic of the distances you can leap to seems to change depending on the camera angle: sometimes, you can leap vast chasms; other times, you can barely hop over a puddle.

7. I hate watching the same cutscenes over and over again. Why doesn't this game let you skip them?

8. The storyline is preposterous. The Olympians are immortal! How can they be killed? And how can you kill people who are already in Hades? And does it make sense that Kratos would be making so much headway on overthrowing the gods of Olympus when he even can't jump over an effin' puddle!? The gods woulda just teamed up and squashed him like a bug!

9. The weapons you get have some grandiose names (e.g., ""Bow of Apollo,"" ""Claws of Hades""), but they're quite ineffectual, even against garden-variety zombies. If you're fighting a run-of-the-mill skeleton and it takes like 50 hits to kill him, it's time for a new weapon. (I love how the much-vaunted ""Bow of Apollo"" has about as much oomph as a spitwad.)

10. Curse you, Yu Suzuki, or whoever invented QTEs (Quick Time Events). I hate them. (These are the times when it's basically a cut scene but you have to press the X button or the O button at the right time.) What is this, the fourth grade? Are we learning to identify shapes this week? Another problem with these is that you can't focus on the cool graphics at all, since you're waiting for the next prompt with gimlet eyes. QTEs need to be outlawed!

11. This game is far too violent for my taste!  It just got to the point where you didn't want to enter QTEs when an opponent was on its last legs since you know the visuals are going to be gross. If this had been a movie, it probably would have received an X for violence.  I mean, you're graphically pulling folk's heads off and stuff  Couldn't they have at least included a ""BLOOD OFF"" option, like they did in Assassin's Creed II?

THIS GAME HAS THE ABSOLUTE WORST, WORST, W-O-R-S-T CONTROLS OF ANY VIDEO GAME THAT HAS EVER EXISTED.

I realize that I am kinda late to the party, critizing a now 5-year-old video game, but since Sonic Team's latest output with the truly awful Sonic the Hedgehog 4 was also aggravating and very poorly done I have to question what kind of work ethic is going on at Sega HQ. The programmers of this game should be blacklisted and banned from working in the industry forever. I'm not kidding. I'll get back to this after I detail the plot.

Doctor Eggman once again uses the power of the Chaos Emeralds to unleash a new nemesis in the form of Dark Gaia (nothing you haven't seen before in the previous Sonic Adventure games) which also smashes the planet apart. Instead of perishing in the vacuum of space the separate segments of the world remain intact, creating themed levels. With the Chaos Emeralds drained Sonic becomes a Werehog at night, giving the game split personality feel with one half being the high-speed 'thrills' that you 'love' and the other being a role-playing brawler. It doesn't really work so well, but I could have tolerated it if it were not for the very, very, incredibly looooong list of crippling flaws that absolutely destroy the game. I do not exaggerate folks, these are not merely superficial flaws. These are glitches that murder Sonic Unleashed right down to the marrow.

As you are probably already aware, the camera system for Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2 was epileptic and staggeringly disorientating. Compared to THIS game it might as well be the calm and measured cinematography of David Lean. The controls are a joke. Normally I'd say something along the lines of you only need luck, not skill or timing to finish some levels, but it just won't do for a game this terrible. A skinned, castrated, vivisected monkey with it's tongue nailed to the floor manipulating the controller with two forks sticking out of its eyeballs has every chance of finishing this game as you do. Make no mistake, the designers of this game better hope and pray that they never meet me, I just might be walking away from that situation in handcuffs. The level design is so poor, sadistic, badly-planned, and so utterly, utterly tedious I actually doubt that anyone at Sega played the game during the testing process.

How can a game this bad get produced and released? How? What is going on at Sega? You'd NEVER get Nintendo treating Mario this way. It truly boggles my mind that a major player in the video game industry can publish such utter garbage, and not only that, but starring their world-famous mascot too.

Do not buy this game. Do not rent or borrow this game. Do not go near it. Do not enter shops with this trash sitting on the shelves. There are not enough words in the universe to fully describe how breathtakingly awful Sonic Unleashed is. I fully intended to stick with it to finish story mode, but I can't put my sanity in that much jeopardy.

5 STARS FOR PLAGIARISM.
BI blatantly and unashamedly steals activities and dialog from video game classics such as Infamous 1 & 2, GTA4, Uncharted 1 & 2, Batman Arkham City, and even Ratchet and Clank.  And probably some others that I'm not familiar with.

Here are some examples:

Ratchet & Clank:  The Skyline is reminiscent of the Grind Rail in Ratchet & Clank's adventures except the Skyline is less fun.  It is disorienting and confusing.  You don't know which way you're going or where you've been.  Or, when or where to get off.  It really seemed to have no purpose except to confuse the player.

Batman Arkham City:  (a) Booker thinks out loud like Batman often does so gamers will know what's he's up to.  (b) Booker follows sparkling footprints (Lady Comstock's) like Batman sometimes does in detective mode.  This is actually stupid and unnecessary since the player simply needs to follow either the game's navigational arrow or klutzy Elizabeth.  In fact, players will find they still frequently need to use the navigational arrows because the footprints often disappear for extended periods of time.  (c) Booker's grapple is also copied from Batman.

Infamous (1 & 2):  (a) Shantytown is a ""knock off"" of Flood Town.  (b) Remember in Infamous when Cole had to choose either a good or evil poster of himself?  For some irrelevant reason there is a poster in BI depicting Booker as a hero.  The poster appears a few times although it has absolutely no significance with respect to the game storyline.

Uncharted 1 & 2:  (a) In BI the girl sidekick is copied except the girl, Elizabeth, lacks personality and purpose unlike Elana and Chloe.  (b) Black and White movies with scratches on film... copied.  (c) Stuck in elevator is copied.  (d) Enemies' shouting in background... copied.  In fact, the exact quote ""You think you can stop me?"" is from the boss battle between Drake and Lazarevic (Chapter 26, ""Tree of Life"") and from the same battle, ""Fight like a man"" is a combination of two of Lazarevic's shouts ""Stand your ground and fight"" and ""Stand your ground like a Man"".  Revolting!  I kept waiting for someone to shout ""Drake""!

GTA4:  (a) Hot dog stands (also prominent in Infamous)...copied.  At least they had a purpose in GTA4.  (b) Enemy shouts...copied.

THE GAME IS MADE ""ON THE CHEAP"":  There are no maps.  No hacking.  No puzzles of any sort.  No Tonics.  The character's faces and wardrobes and the game's environment lack detail and are certainly not on par with contemporary high-quality games.  Not even close.  Remember in Bioshock 1 there was a different black and white film that illustrated the function of each plasmid you got?  Well in BI the same short film is played for all 8 vigors.  Also, the game is short.  How short is it?  Well, there was enough space left over to put another ENTIRE, BIG game on the disc, so figure it out.

Although there are many weapons (13) and vigors (8) available you'll soon find you only use 2 or 3 of each because most are relatively ineffective.  Also, the fact that upgrades are prohibitively expensive forces you to only use a few.  I mostly used the shotgun, the sniper rifle and occasionally the RPG or volley gun.  Short range and long range.

FRUSTRATING TO PLAY:  There are frequent text ""briefs"" that appear on screen to advise and instruct the gamer what's going on or what to do.  However, they only last for a few seconds and then they are gone.  Forever!  If you're not a world-class speed-reader you are S.O.L.  Not like in RDR or GTA4 where you could go to ""Briefs"" in the menu and re-read anything you may have missed.  Many scenes are either too dark or too light to the extent you can't see the enemy who's trying to kill you.  So you get killed.  Often there is so much glare in your eyes you don't know where to aim.  Or you will hear shots fired at you that hit you but you don't know where they're coming from so you don't know how to retaliate.  Many of the bad-guys are very hard to kill because they violently jump from side-to-side when you try to shoot them.  And there is no ""Enemy Life-Bar"" to tell you how you're holding up in the Boss final battle...Cheap again!

The voice acting of both Elizabeth and Booker is mundane and of high school drama-class quality.  It's not even close to that of the main characters in RDR, Batman Arkham City, GTA4 or Uncharted 1, 2 or 3.  It often seemed the BI actors had read their scripts at different times and the dialog was later edited into a conversation.  And it did sound like they were ""reading"" the script instead of ""acting"" it.  Of course, it doesn't help that the dialog is also corny.

Many of the game characters are cartoonish and unrealistic looking.  Some look like they belong in a Ratchet/Clank adventure or a Disney movie.  In fact, Elizabeth reminded me of (a very annoying) Snow-White.  For one thing, she sounds like she's wearing wooden shoes as she ""klip-klops"" everywhere.  She is always either klop-klopping, bending over while looking at something irrelevant, squatting, leaning against something or just standing there glaring at you.  She's like a puppy you're always tripping over because it's always in your way.  She does two things:  (1) She picks locks for you, and (2) she says ""Booker, catch"" as she tosses you a coin, a vigor, ammo, or some health.  These are the things that you enjoyed doing for yourself in the prior Bioshock games.  But in BI when you come to a locked door or safe you just ask Elizabeth to open it for you.  And while ""in the heat of battle"" she will come to your aid with whatever you're low on.  I found myself wishing she would just go away so I could continue the game without her.  I tried to kill her several times but couldn't.  If she weren't there, the game would have been much more suspenseful, dramatic and fun.  Fact is, she ruined the game for me.

The game has no intrigue.  It was like one endless Easter-egg hunt.  Non-stop searching.  Search this.  Search that.  80% of your time is spent searching corpses and everything else.  Not much fun.  Not much of a challenge.  I guess you're supposed to get a big thrill every time you find another dollar.  No hacking to get stuff.  You either get stuff by searching or Elizabeth gives it to you.  I repeat, not much fun.

In BI there is no strategizing about how you're going to ambush a Big Daddy or confront a Big Sister.  No setting traps in preparation for Splicers that will come for a Little Sister when you set her down to gather Adam.  No need to maneuver to hack a surveillance alarm.  No more hacking vending machines or safes.  No hack darts.  No need and therefore no fun.

Also, as someone pointed out in a comment on this review, there is a baptism in the game.  In fact, there are two and you can't continue the game unless you submit to the second one.  I'm sure there are many who would be uncomfortable with this.  It's the sort of thing that doesn't belong in a video game and really should have been omitted.

In summary, the game is cheap and boring.  The best thing about the game is the addition of Bioshock 1 on the disk.  ""Game of the Year"" is a joke.  ""Game of the Week""...Maybe.  Don't be mislead by the hyped-up BI trailers.  They are deceptive and not representative of actual gameplay.  Also, I am very suspicious of the many 5 star reviews for BI.  Would Irrational Games buy 100 or so games at $60 each just so they boost the ratings by submitting many 5 star reviews?  Well let's do the math.  100 X $60 = $6000, right?  That's a pretty low promotion expense for a product that is expected to sell more than 4 million units at up to $60 each.

127269,1.0,False,"07 14, 2008",A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B00104KJ4W,D. Mok,"I've been playing the Dynasty Warriors series for years.  The previous games were by and large flawed, but tended to have some redeeming value...and Dynasty Warriors 5 even approached a level as close to perfection as the limited conceits of the game would reach.

Lo and behold, Dynasty Warriors 6 comes out, and *everything* is now broken.  This game is so bad that I'm breaking my two-year pause in writing reviews.  It's just impossible not to vent.

Pros:
- The acting has marginally improved from previous Dynasty Warriors games.  That's about the only improvement.

Cons:
- It seems Koei has swapped in the game mechanics and proportions from the Samurai Warriors series.  So now your character is smaller onscreen.  The physical motion of the characters no longer feels unique; every warrior moves the same, the weapons feel the same, except a couple of useless novelty characters (eg. the new Dian Wei) who move like they're tied down with lead weights.  You'll feel like you're playing with a controller that's been soaked in beef fat.  And they've filled the entire screen with running peons and your allies so that now when you enter a major skirmish, the whole screen flies with character names and hyperactive figures so that you can't even tell where your actual opponents are; they just drown in an ocean of writhing masses.  The overhead maps are now so tiny that you can't even use them to locate the enemies around you; the red icons (enemies) look exactly the same as the blue icons (allies).
- They've reverted to the horrible system of:  Utterly useless allies, commanders made of butter who love to rush that spot where three super-powered enemy warriors are standing, and giant maps with objectives that require you riding from one end to the other about eight times per mission.  This shouldn't be categorized as a fighting game; this is a ""running game"".
- Allies are utterly worthless unless you're just about to score a killing blow on a super-charged enemy general...in which case your allies will rush right in to steal your kill with one last hit...and boom, you fail your mission target!  Thank you very much!  You no longer get a bodyguard, and even your horse seems hell-bent on messing you up by trotting away just as you're about to mount.  Oh, and there will be many times when you're running around after a battle, unable to find your horse because it becomes invisible when it's behind you!  Fancy playing hide-and-seek?
- Your character is anemic.  The ""Renbu"" system they implemented on this game is about the worst idea they've ever had.  Why?  In previous games, you get more attacks in your combos by getting better weapons.  Once you get the maximum, your character is powered up and you're all set.  Here, the ""Renbu"" system means that your character starts out every level with only three attacks in the chain.  The ""Renbu meter"" shoots down if you're not fighting...and let's remember that this game specializes in making you run from one end to another with nothing in between, so by the time you get to that big battle, your character is back down to a miserable three attacks.  It's the equivalent of starting every mission as an untrained, newbie character.
- Enemies are overpowered.  This has been the case for most Dynasty Warriors games, but in this case, they've now made enemy blocking impossible to break by getting behind the enemy.  What's the result?  Enemy generals will just block and waste your time until either their allies get behind you to gut you, or they'll just wait until your other allies elsewhere fall like flies, or your commander runs headlong into oblivion.  Anybody remember when Double Dragon added the block feature?  The ability to block indefinitely just doesn't work in a one-against-many fighting game.  You do have special moves that can get past a block, but they're useless because they do almost no damage, and most of your characters are too slow to combo after performing it, so the enemy will just resume blocking after you break their guard.  They can afford to, because it takes something like 300 mashes of the buttons to kill one minor general, and after every mission, even one of the easier ones, my hands are paralyzed.  You're supposed to be able to kill those super enemies by powering up with Special Attacks or Musou attacks, but many missions will pit you against a super enemy right at the beginning (eg. ""The Battle of Chang Ban"", a mission that made me want to smash my console), before you've had a chance to pick up power-up items or even build a Renbu or Musou meter.  And in those battles, if you get hit by one enemy combo, you die...not to mention that this game will stack three, four, even six minor generals in the same place so that you're one pygmy fighting against seven giants.
- It's possible to train up your character, but now it takes so long that by the time I'm ready to play that character's story, I'm bored with the character.  And they've now left about 90 per cent of the characters locked -- you can't play them, period, unless you play one of only about half a dozen characters to unlock them.  Which means you can't pick the characters you want until you've finished with some of the really weak, really annoying characters first.  Boo.
- The geography is abysmal.  I can't tell you how many times I'm pounding on one super-powered general, and after about two straight minutes of hitting the guy with hundreds of attacks, I juggle him off a ledge and he falls into a river, and I have no way of pursuing because if I did, it would take five minutes to travel back to where I need to be and I'd fail the mission.  So all that hard fighting work is killed by bad game design.  The addition of countless annoying mountains and valleys means that the designers now make you weave left and right just to get across a quarter of the map, and if you happened to take the wrong route...sorry, your commander's dead.  As I've said, this is a ""running game"" -- like a Mario game without any of the fun of a true ""platform"" game.
- They've also taken out many of the visual options that would have alleviated the problems.  For example, many parts of the maps are so dark you can barely see a tree in front of you, but there's no option to brighten the display.  And the badly acted, repetitive ""movie scenes"" can no longer be turned off, so if you're fighting a battle for the 50th time, you have to mash the buttons to skip it -- and even then, your character will grind to a halt, putting you at a disadvantage.  They used to offer an option to turn off those movies; I have no idea what possessed them to take that out.

All I can think is that Koei has finally lost the plot and passed the point of no return in its perverse thinking that frustration equals fun.  Like Dynasty Warriors:  Gundam, this game is frustrating for the sake of being frustrating.  I suppose if all you want is a higher blood pressure, a lot of rage, and the feeling that you're at the mercy of game designers making you jump through hoops, then by all means indulge in this game.  Everybody else, just go play Rock Band, or NBA '08, or any other game that is actually, well, fun -- an enjoyable activity rather than what Dynasty Warriors 6 is -- a tooth-pulling source of stress.",Die-nasty.

I know because I received this controller today, used it for an hour, went and bought a licensed WiiU Pro controller at my local Target and am using it now, the difference is NIGHT and DAY in terms of fine control capabilities of these controllers.

These knock offs would work fine if you have kids playing mario kart, but if you are playing a game like Breath of the Wild and you want detailed, minute aiming control of your ranged weapons this controller will be a complete disappointment.

The WiiU gamepad thumbsticks are excellent and track motion with a very high level of granular detail, so you can move either very very slowly or very rapidly.  This knock-off controller does NOT have that granular level of control, you're either not moving at all or suddenly moving at full speed, see below.  For singular input such as ""turn right"" or ""turn left"" that's fine, but when you need to carefully aim a bow so that you get a head shot you simply can't do it with this knock off controller unless you just get lucky.

The actual WiiU Pro controller uses the same excellent thumbsticks as the Gamepad.  These knock offs use garbage thumbsticks that are all on or all off.  No good.

Seems decent quality and worked fine with my WiiU in terms of pairing and all buttons working, BUT thumbstick deadzone is huge and acceleration is 100% when you finally get out of the deadzone.  Precise aiming is not possible.

If you care at all about stealth accuracy with ranged weapons in a game like Zelda BOTW this controller is NOT good.  When aiming the bow reticle with the right thumbstick there is a HUGE deadzone (where there is no movement at all while moving the thumbstick) then once you get out of the deadzone acceleration is instantly almost 100%.

For the non-tech nerds, that means:  You aim the bow, move the thumbstick... nothing happens.... move it more... nothing happens... move it a little more and suddenly the aim point moves an inch across the screen.  You simply CAN'T aim accurately with this controller.

My gaming rigs aren't slouches either, the computers run other recent games like Team Fortress 2 and Gears of War PC just fine but SimCIty Societies flat out doesn't even start up.

I thought SimCity DS was bad, at least that worked!  It's become clear to me that EA has butchered the game and SimCity is never going to get any better than SC 3000.  It's time to move on I guess and forget what a great game this franchise used to be under Maxis control.

When I first played it as a demo a year ago I immediately purchased it because of the fun community aspects and advanced and unique interactions within the game. I met many people in the game and developed many friends, worked tirelessly to advance my character, and had a whole lot of fun. For a guy who loves Star Wars and a guy who likes computer gaming, this game was fantastic. But all that changed on the dark day of April 28, 2005, when Sony Online Entertainment butchered this game in a weak attempt to lighten it up for casual players they hoped to draw in after Episode III.

I will not get into specifics, but suffice to say this so called ""Combat Upgrade"" tore the soul out of this game. A mass exodus of easily fifty-percent of the game's total playerbase commenced within the first few weeks of this patch- some of these players being veterans of the games who had been playing for nearly two years. Glitches were abound, balance fell apart, and it became so bitterly comical that my character, a pretty experienced avatar, fell dead to the killer sting of a butterfly in game. Combine this with the fact that some people's characters are irrefutably damaged, many of my personal in-game items including my home and weapons all disappeared, and the fact that this game is now nothing more than a 15 dollar a month exercise in futility and you'll soon realize that this is one game you don't want to own.

So be smart. Don't buy Star Wars Galaxies or its derivitives. It costs money to play, and there are more bugs and glitches in this game than in the first release of it back in August of 2003. It breaks my heart that I have lost so many friends and a great experience, but this game is truly forsaken. It is not the same game anymore, it is completely different.

Repetitive

Reddit did a far better job than I could ever do summarizing the ways this game fell short: [...]

Biggies listed there are:
The loss of planetary physics, which were said to govern many different systems, seemingly in a cascading effect from the top down
The retooling of ships to make them all functionally identical, rather than having different classes for different playstyles, essentially homogenizing ship play into a single playstyle
The reworking of factions from something with broader significance, into the very simplistic system we have now
Resource distribution following none of the rules that were spoken of, instead resource variety is more shallow than we'd been lead to believe, so distribution was seemingly homogenized regardless of planet-based factors (likely an effect of the loss of planetary physics)
This also had a knock-on effect for trading, which was trivialized by the ease in which most resources could be found
also crafting, which went from something Sean hoped would be community drive a la Minecraft (likely because there were far more resources originally, a la Minecraft, there's more evidence of this than just the crafting,) to something that could only be done through recipes the game must teach you before you can actually use

The story is fine although I truly hated most of the characters you have to help in order to get help from them in return. The cut-scenes are okay besides the fact the player models look just as good as they did in the first gears of war. Shadows jumping all over across their faces with no reason behind it. It's as bug free as an mmorpg on launch day. I got stuck in cover without being able to move or shoot multiple times in single and multi player. I guess this game is aimed to the older hardcore fans of gta 4, and if it isn't, then I am completely lost on what the demographics were supposed to be. The graphics aren't anything to write home about either. The scenery looks about as good as a 360 game could look, and since it's a multiplatform game, it would never look much better on ps3 because of lazy programmers. Unfortunately if this game is in fact the best the 360 can offer graphic-wise, then I truly do wish for the next gen of consoles. Gears of war 2 was about as good as games look on the 360 thus far and it neither was all that amazing. But graphics don't make a game. And neither does 10 minutes of pressing the A button to ride your horse to the next town. The game has checkpoints it temporarily saves at just before something happens in the story, but you have to rent a room in one of the towns and sleep in the bed to actually save your game before turning it all off. The saving feature seems misplaced in an open world game like this. The best things about this game are the things happening along the road as you ride to your next destination. A person getting shot at by the sheriff or someone about to be executed by soldiers. You are able to intervene during all of these events which makes for a much more lively open world experience. Unfortunately this game tries to make the ""wild west"" a little too authentic with nothingness for so long in between locations. I could not stand this game after about 8 hours. I tried to give it longer because I aim to beat the games so hyped up like this one, but alas it was too much for this hardcore gamer. I never felt anything towards any of the characters in the game which i think really made some of the things that happened less meaningful in every aspect. If you are indeed a die-hard GTA 4 fan, then you can go ahead and spend as much money on this as you want, but I highly recommend people uninterested in the western genre or people who enjoy a game to have some sort of pacing unlike an mmorpg to look elsewhere.

Now.... I have playes many kinect games.... never before have I had issues with control over the functions and movements as I did this game. So, it's not from a lack of experience or ability to use a kinect function... this game just stinks.

This game could have been great but is tainted with the stink of DRM (SecuROM) enforced limited installs. The DRM is a part of the game that you can't avoid if you install it so I must focus my review on the DRM. If you are a hardware enthusiast and change your hardware and reinstall your OS often as a lot do you will hit a wall very quickly with this type of DRM. Then you have to call them and hope that they believe you purchased the game in order to play. If they don't believe you I don't know what the procedure is but you probably won't be playing anytime soon. There has been talk of a system revocation tool for the end user but I haven't seen it and it would just be another hoop that they want you the legitimate customer to jump through and hope it works. I would recommend that everyone stop purchasing games with these limitations. The only people hurt by these limitations are the legitimate customers. Pirates will have the games from day one regardless. The game itself has been getting good press which makes me sad because the limiting DRM that it is saddled with will keep me from getting it.

Yes, your character has some cool moves but when is sliding across a room full of bad guys in slow motion profitable when you only kill two? The platforming and aiming mechanism are weak. Also, the so-called ""upgrades"" that you can purchase should have been gimmes to start with!

UNBOXING:

The game is a standard Xbox CD and  comes in a clamshell that only has two pamphlets.  Neither one tells you how to play.

GAMEPLAY:

The game is very detail oriented, and replicates a virtual Disneyland to a tee.  However, the controlling of the avatars is a PAIN IN THE @$$!  The game will often drop the player for no reason.  When coming back into the game, you need to wave frantically and it doesn't always (mostly never) pick you up again.  Then when you get back in the game, your avatar randomly changes: from boy to girl and vice versa, and from race to race.

There's a little ticket avatar that tells you the basics of movement: essentially hold your hand out to go directions forward, left and right.  Wave to interact with other avatars.  Hands in the air to take a picture.  But that's it.  As far as how to play any of the games, there are no instructions.

PROS:

- It's Disneyland!
- Voice overs sound like Disney Character cartoons

CONS:

- Controlability (BIG CON)
- No instructions

OVERALL:

This game IS NOT for anyone under the age of 10.  All of my kids cannot play this game because of the glitches in the contolling avatars.  They all gave up within 5-10 minutes of playing.

I just don't feel like Aerosmith is Guitar Hero friendly. It just got boring for me to play. Someone else already said everything I wanted to say. The songs get boring, and some of them are ridiculous. A song featuring Run DMC? What the hell?

Well, whatever. It's definitely not worth the $103 I paid for it and the controller. Ah, the controller, here at least an improvement. The controller is modified (though it doesn't look it)from the wireless one from GH: III. It has the same detachable neck, but it doesn't slide away from the neck. I played all the way through the game tonight with the controller, and never once did I have the problem of the controller not reading the button I was holding. And they also fixed the strum bar, which I found over-sensitive on the previous game.

The ""always online"" requirement to play this video game is a complete disaster. They did it for one reason alone - to stop piracy. Not to help you out, not to make the game better... no. Just to make them some more money. And the result is game play that is so disastrous, so crippled, so dysfunctional that it is easily the worst video game launch in recent history.

So here is the deal - you can't play unless you are online. So don't even think about it while traveling, on a plane, etc. You also can't play when they are having server issues, which is basically all the time.

You also cannot save games to your computer. That's right. No local saves. So if something goes wrong with their servers (which happens, literally constantly) in the middle of playing, you lose everything. Happened to me several times. And that is assuming you can get online and play at all, which is also very hard.

Let me make this clear - if the EA servers are not working properly, YOU CANNOT PLAY THE GAME AT ALL. No single player. No nothing. It. Just. Doesn't. Work. At. All.

Oh, and here is the best part. EA has said they have a solution to the overloaded servers - they are just going to remove features from the game! So even though we paid for it, they are just going to strip out features to ease the server load. Here's a link to the news article where they said that gem [...]

This game is ridiculous for this day and age in the gaming world.

The headset is extremely easy to setup.  All you have to do is first turned on your PS3 and then the headset and you're all done.  The controls are all located on the left-hand side, and are very easily reachable with your left hand.

The 7.1 virtual surround sound is just that ""virtual,"" so don't expect anything precise for your gaming experience.  You will be able to hear people coming up from behind you, from your right and left, but it's more of a general direction than anything specific in terms of being able to discern how far they are from you.

The bass is perfect for your gaming pleasure.  The mids and lows are kind of flat due to the ""virtual"" enhancements, although I do find myself using the virtual sound exclusively when playing.  The only negative thing about the headset, and hence the 4-star rating instead of 5, is that the battery will only last around 4 hours or so on slightly below the normal/middle setting, which is not good at all.  But what more can anyone expect from a headset of this level of performance.  The good thing is that you can use your cell phone recharger to recharge this headset if you have one that fits its connection.

Overall, I'm very content with this purchase since I was able to get it for less than the $99 advertised here.  I would recommend this headset to anyone needing an online-mic as well as the ability to not disturb anyone while playing their games.  A very solid 4 stars, and 5 stars if it was
priced around $59 or less.

Edit: After playing multi-player with Homefront and other games online, I am lowering my original 4-star rating for this Sony headset DOWN to a 1-STAR rating.  There is major interference with the internet connection of the PS3 when you turn this headset on, rendering the online multi-player games UNPLAYABLE.  Both the PS3 and this headset use the 2.4Ghz band, and so there are major interference when both the PS3 and this headset are turned on to the internet wirelessly.  This is very unfortunate, because I do love the headset when it's working properly and I get the full 4 bars of signal strength.  But then most of the time the connection would dropped to 1 bar, resulting in very choppy gameplay (if playable at all).

I suspect that if your PS3 is connected to the internet by an ethernet cable, and not by its wireless connection, the headset would work perfectly and without interference.

I've solved the Wi-Fi interference problem by connecting the headset's doogle to a USB extension cord, and relocated it away from the PS3.  Still.  As an official PS3 product, the headset should have worked properly with the PS3 without interference and without having to use the additional USB extension cord, which is a separate purchase.  1-Star rating.

I tried checking out info on the game, but the most I could find prerelease was the cast from the show saying you should buy it because it's awesome, without giving any info about features, etc. That should have been my first clue. My son got this for Christmas and we were very excited to start playing. Unlike others, we did not mind the retro style graphics at all. The intro to the game was as retro as they come but that made it even more funny. Then the actual game started.

We were excited for the first few levels. But we quickly realized there is ZERO variation in the dungeon levels at all. All the same monsters with the exact same appearance, one after the other after the other. Upgrades are also stupidly expensive, and seeing as you can't save your gold, you have to play for incredibly long amounts of time. Any money you have after leaving the dungeon is gone unless you spend it, and if you don't have enough to buy anything, it's gone for good. Effectively making the hours of dungeon crawling absolutely pointless. There is no equipment, save for weapons that you swap out FPS style. So you will literally spend hours of crawling through level after level of the exact same dungeon for NO REASON AT ALL! Just for funsies! Except it's not. At all.

Go ahead, I'll wait.

...did you notice?  The people responsible for the creation of the other two titles were Microsoft.  Dungeon Siege 1 and 2, both of which were phenomenal games, were made by different people.  Now, Microsoft often makes mistakes when it comes to games... it's true, they do.  In fact, they are quite low on my ""favorites"" list.  However, one thing they make sure to do is to stay away from the actual development of a game and they don't bother or influence the games ideas and creation.  Square Enix on the other hand has to make everything cutscene-happy, CG-intensive and storyline-exaggerated.

The characters and story in this game suck.  Beyond that, even.  The voice acting is annoying, the personalities are non-existent... there is nothing good here.  The problem with this is that you're STUCK with the buggers for a long time!  AND THEY TALK A LOT!  ABOUT NOTHING!

The gameplay is miserable, the combat is boring, they removed all the identifying factors out of this game that the original two had... it's just miserable.

How do you level up?  Points and Attributes of course, like any good JRPG.  Oh wait, it was better before and we have enough JRPGs.  I want the old Dungeon Siege back with leveling up based on what you used, how often, where, how, when, and why.  I miss the open-world that the original had, seeing as this game sticks you with used gum to a small and tedious 1 lane highway track that constantly tells you to backtrack over and over and over to prolong your stay in the stupid, boring areas that don't contain any fun whatsoever.

The fighting isn't fun, but there isn't a whole lot of it.  The zones are bland and they aren't very big.  The map is...

(There is no map by the way.)

...non-existent?  Where do I go?!

The game is so front and backwards with the quest-lines that you seriously never know where to go.  ""Go to the cave to the east"" and you go to the... where's east?  To the right?

That falls under the 700 category but is technically a ""laptop version""Older  Macs use 600 versions which aren't supported at all.  The new Mac Pro's don't even use theATI  Raedon cards- they use ATI Firepro line. Technically the Firepro line should be pretty similar (identical) to the Raedon line but with some upgrades. Speaking in a strictly legal sense- that excludes ALL macs. iMacs and Macbooks use a ""laptop GPU"" Mac Pro's since 2013 don't even have the option of installing a second hand compatible GPU.

The only good things about this game is the art direction and the story.  The graphics and story are basically ""anime/manga-ish"", both of which, while not awesome, give this game alot of character and uniqueness.

However, if I wanted an anime I would have bought an anime.  I buy games for gameplay and this game is an absolute failure in the gameplay department.  Here is a few of the points that irritated me with this game and why after 1 day and only 7 levels I put it on eBay.

- Shoots that ""hit"" targets (it is obvious when you miss a target) and grenades that land 1ft from targets did no damage.
- No strategy required.  Most maps are narrow and small which basically limits you to one strategy.  You are basically limited to the strategy designed by the developers and that is it.
- A stealth mission where you are supposed to slip by the enemy to get back together with your platoon.  However, the ONE path through the level brings you in front of every trooper in the level.  Even those that you sneak behind turn around and fire on you.
- The always fun ""invinsible enemy"" level who can run all over the map in one turn and shoot her ultimate weapon that instantly kills your team.  How do you survive said level?  That's right, you have to use the one strategy designed by the developers.
- Rudimentary battlefield.  The only battle cover is tall grass, sandbags, and trenches.  However, these do not hide you from the enemy nor lower your chances from getting hit by fire.  All it provides is that it negates the auto-kill headshoot.  No protection from trees, no popping out from the sides of buildings to fire.  Basically move, shoot, move shoot.
- Weak weapon/armor/troop leveling flow chart and no weapon customization.
- No multiplayer

Worse actually. I took a week off of work to do nothing but play Battlefront. Wife even bought a Black Christmas Tree and put Star Wars ornaments all over it, with white lights and stars. I'm not a Star Wars Superfan, but I was fourteen when Star Wars (original) came out. - So I REALLY was looking forward to this, and had played the beta.

Within the first 30 min after clicking the Launch Button at midnight, I thought I was going to be ill. The game-play is SERIOUSLY flawed and feels like it was created by two totally different teams. It's like they spent a year recreating the Star Wars universe, and then paid some low rent intern to code the actual gameplay over a weekend. By far the absolute worse combat experience you could have imagined. There's no logic to anything. Zero - It's just random chaotic deathmatch with objectives that have no value. It's much more important to pick up the random ""perks"" that spawn on the map than to play any objectives. Actually you can get a great score by just holding back and picking up the vehicle spawns only.

To say the GamePlay is written for children would be considered borderline ""Child Abuse"". How could it be possible to have such a beautiful looking and sounding game, (and it does look fantastic) with authentic Star Wars atmosphere, have game mechanics, balance, hit detection, and such skill-less gameplay, be so poorly implemented? The game play equates to being blindfolded, tossed into a small pit with thirty-nine other blindfolded people, and everyone given a chainsaw.  The whole time you're playing you keep thinking to yourself ""Surely this just cannot be this bad.""  But it is.  Then reality sets in.... "" I spent how much on this? ""

I literally, (I'm not kidding)..... I literally walked up behind a guy, shoved my blaster rifle into his back, opened up and completely overheated my rifle, only to have him turn, and one shot me. - I've been killed by a shotgun style gun, from a guy nearly on the other side of the map. - Any other game, they would be considered to be a possible hacker. But not in this. THIS IS THE ""GAME"". Random, death, from any and all directions with no meaning, or purpose.

No matter what play style you prefer; camping, attacking, ninja captures, etc... is meaningless. Shoot one time and fifteen other people will just open up on you from all directions.

I don't write many reviews at all, but this is disgusting and an insult to the Star Wars franchise. Now I have to look at this Star Wars themed Christmas tree for the next month that my wonderful wife made for me...... to remind me just how crappy this game is.

I went to purchase for 3 identical systems, mine and my two son's. It is a lot to always drop $150 for each new game that comes out. But I have been doing it for years. (The family that kills together, stays together! :).

Yes, as others have noted, this type of a system don't keep the pirates away, they hacked it already. It keeps the people that pay away.

Since that time I have gone through four or five XBOX Pro consoles with problems ranging from no video on the screen to the games freezing for no reason at all. In addition to the XBOX Pro's failing, I have also had to have two XBOX Elites replaced or repaired since purchasing my first one in January of 2008.  The problem with the Elite consoles was that the shoddy DVD drives could fail to read Game CD's until after 30 - 40 tries of opening/closing the drives. In fact I have just boxed up my 2nd Elite console to send back to Microsoft. None of my XBOX Pro's have lasted more than seven months, and in terms of my XBOX Elite, it will be my THIRD in less than a year.

I can go into every single reason why my XBOX's have failed but why bother when you can just as easily go to the multitudes of message boards and read the horror stories of this extremely unreliable console. When I purchased my XBOX Elite in December of 2008, it started having problems of not always reading game discs two weeks after purchase, the only reason I didn't return it to Microsoft then was because I knew all they would do is just send me a POS refurb. I dealt the with the problem for several months until finally it started freezing and RROD'ing on me; giving me no choice but to return it. Now my most recent Elite is doing the exact same thing in less than three months!

What makes things even worse is Microsoft's customer support is absolutely useless. As with many companies that don't care about customer service, their XBOX support is somewhere in India and the customer service reps are hard to understand, clueless, unhelpful, and sometimes even downright rude. When I was returning my 4th or 5th XBOX Pro console earlier this year, the rep didn't even want to process the return because he claimed that my warranty expired. This was despite the fact that I had purchased an extended warranty plan THROUGH MICROSOFT and had the actual print out of the warranty certificate that Microsoft sent me. This idiot even tried to tell me that the warranty I purchased for my XBOX Pro console in November of 2006 was for my XBOX Elite console which was purchased in January of 2008. Not only does it make ZERO sense that I could even purchase a warranty for an Elite console I did not even own at the time, the XBOX Elite console was not even out in 2006! I had to fight with him for over an half hour before I got the supervisor on the phone who agreed to let me send it back provided I included a copy of the warranty certificate. Yet even after all of that the geniuses at Microsoft STILL did not apply my warranty to my console so I had to spend another week straightening that out. With me finally sending a letter to the main corporate office stating that I have an extended warranty and I expect them to honor it.

I will admit when working I think the Microsoft XBOX 360 console oflffers the best in terms of overall game play and features, but what good is all of that if the console breaks all the time? I am nearing 32 years old and I have bought tens of thousands of dollars (maybe even more) worth of electronic equipment and only ONCE have I had to return something to the manufacturer due to a malfunction. Yet in under two years of owning the XBOX 360, I am on my eighth one. This is absolutely unacceptable and Microsoft has proven that not only can they NOT make a reliable console, they have also proven that they don't care. Even after Microsoft spends over $1 billion to ""correct"" the numerous problems with the XBOX 360 console, failure rates are still off the charts. Heck, I can't even get one that lasts a year. I have taken every precaution to ensure I am doing all that I can to help the extremely fragile console function properly but NOTHING helps. I don't plug it in to a power strip, I always lay it horizontal. I ensure it has adequate ventilation, but guess what? it still fails. I know for sure that if I dusted off my old 8 bit Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, Nintendo GameCube, or Sony PlayStation (The VERY first one that came out), they would STILL work flawlessly. Yet in two years time, the amount of XBOX 360 consoles I have gone through is MORE than the total amount of gaming consoles I have owned in my entire life!

As much as I love playing the multitude of fun games on the XBOX 360, once my warranties have expired and they will no longer ""fix"" the console free of charge, I am done with Microsoft based consoles. If I am unable to fix it myself (which I had to do with the first gen XBOX) then all of my games will be sold or donated. I am not really interested in the PS3 or GameCube, so once my 360 bites the dust for the last time, then its back to PC gaming for me.

In any case, I will never spend another DIME on Microsoft's extremely unreliable pieces of junk that they call the XBOX 360 or any future consoles they plan to make. I urge potential buyers to think long and hard before spending this kind of money on the XBOX 360, if you still insist then I suggest a replacement plan AT THE PLACE OF PURCHASE, I don't even recommend getting Microsoft's service contract as the reps don't even know how to handle that correctly.",The most unreliable piece of equipment I have ever owned.,1225843200,3,{'Edition:': ' Pro 20GB'},

I often associate Golden Axe with Streets of Rage since the gameplay in the first games was very similar (I also bought them on the same day back in March 1993).

So once again I had to try to get help from Steam and they are not responsive. In the end I just threw it away since it was already past the warranty period.

Now, I want to make it clear from the start that this is primarily a Warning Review, focusing on little or non advertised facts on BIOSHOCK 2. Nevertheless, my points on the game design and gameplay follow. But first things first:

FACT 1 (UNDISCLOSED):
The game requires Internet Connection to install and play because it HAS TO BE ACTIVATED. This is nowhere to be found in the Amazon product description so be warned, you will not be able to install and play this game on a PC that cannot access the internet. This is more serious than it seems (please read on).

FACT 2 (LITTLE ADVERTISED):
BIOSHOCK 2 requires you to setup an OnLine WindowsLIVE Account in order to save the game, claim achievements and auto-update. However, similarly to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fallout-3/dp/B001REZLY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fallout 3</a>, it is also possible to create and use an OffLine WindowLIVE account. So, this is not a major worry - unless achievements is important for your enjoyment of course. In that case, you will have to be OnLine to play even a Single-Player session.

FACT 3 (UNDISCLOSED):
This game comes with an INSTALLATION LIMIT. Some would argue that a limit of fifteen installations is large enough for anyone. I, on the other hand, would argue that the length of the chain is of little importance, as long it stays attached to one's leg. Any limit on the number of installations makes BIOSHOCK 2 a rent-a-game. For good reason.

The ACTIVATION REQUIREMENT together with the LIMITED INSTALLATIONS mean that the copy of this game that you paid full price for, well,...never actually becomes yours. The possibility of you replaying the game in the future depends on both the survival of the publisher and its willingness to allow you to so some years down the road (both major uncertainties). And, no, I very much doubt that failing corporations will have the decency and the resources - not to mention the legal rights - to develop and release an Activation-Requirement-Removal patch. The usual practice is to pull the plug and disappear into the night.

The really insulting part is that all this is done for no reason whatsoever! If ""more installations are available upon request"" what is exactly their purpose in the first place? Why pay for the activation servers and the phone service to give out activations upon request for ever - when you could have had a game with no Activation Limits to begin with?
And the first person who tries to answer that by using the phrase ""to fight-piracy"", first get me a tissue because I am laughing to tears and, secondly, please simply google to find out how that fight is going.

Most game developers/publishers (from THQ and KALYPSO to UBISOFT and EA) have realized that asking your customers to jump through hoops only for the privilege of ...buying and using your product is not the way to earn neither their trust nor their hard-earned money. Especially during a recession.
So what they did was scale back on any intrusive, draconian and (possibly) illegal forms of DRM. All except 2K GAMES and some former soviet game developers that is. Protecting one's investment and labor is only fair. Insulting your customers and stealing back the product you just sold to them in not.

Now, if anyone still cares: I tried the game on a friend's computer and it is ...not very good either. It is not even as good as the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BioShock/dp/B000MK694E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BioShock</a>.

Apparently the graphics have been left to age on their own - and have done so ungracefully. Max out the details and see the...pixels upclose and personal staring back at you! (Before anyone asks: WinXP on INTEL i7 920, nVIDIA GTX260 and 3GB of RAM).
The water/dry-land transitions have been hastily slapped together (swirling bubbles but no changing level of water in my faceplate?).
The guns are slow, hold annoyingly little ammo and are either too powerful or too hard to aim. And that is not the worst part either.

The worst part is that playing Big Daddy is a cumbersome chore! You move like crusted molasses, jump (and land) like a pig that ate too many beans and have the faceplate almost constantly obscuring your view.
If venturing into the ocean floor impressed you, well, think again: you can be directed to walk around but you cannot shoot while outside Rapture.

All in all, a mediocre game that is definitely NOT worth its DRM trouble!

I had been anticipating this game way back at E3 of last year, when Randy Pitchford, hype man of Gearbox, introduced the first playable demo of Aliens: Colonial Marines.  What a difference a year makes.  This is bar-none, the worst Xbox 360 game I have ever played.  Yes, the graphics are shockingly subpar, the storyline is uninspired, and the animation is clunky.  But what really ticks me off is how a game so disturbingly unpolished was even allowed to be released in the first place.  Case one is the atrocious amount of screen tearing in the Xbox 360 version of the game.  It's everywhere, even in the cut scenes.  Case two is the blatant misrepresentation of how this game was going to look and play.  ACM is definately not the version of the game I saw in the demo.  Whole levels and cut scenes have either been restructered for the worse or ommitted altogether.  The creepy ambient lighting that was hyped is practically non-existent, replaced by a dull, gray glow.  What's left seems like an early beta version of the game that was scrapped together with a $1.50 budget.  I could go on and on about how abysmal this game is, but quite frankly, the reviewers below me have thoroughly done a good job describing this game's faults.  So will there be a game that does this property justice?  Given this title, it's hard to say considering that this was supposed to be the ultimate Aliens gaming experience.

Every game of Rockstar is a sentimental trifle in acceptable, liberal political attitudes about Modern America. The overwhelming majority of little kids and teenagers are dramatically undereducated, and so the potential seriousness latent in the themes of course go unnoticed. What we get is reified caricatures of Western truisms previously communicated to us by older entertainment, framed by the typically woeful Rockstar scripts and action sequencing. It's just another GTA in Western garb.

As with GTA, auto-aim dominates all action, so the gameplay becomes very repetitive and boring, all of which is channeled through the X button, that little button you have to mash a million times to run or ride anywhere. Unlike Last of Us, gameplay sequencing has absolutely no direct relation to the narrative. The narrative itself is stitched together by the usual GTA array of anomalous 'fetch' missions, whose only purpose is to accelerate the peculiar hastiness typical of GTA games to its ultimate conclusion. Thus, everything depends on 'story,' and Rockstar is a developer that refuses to provide a coherent narrative but instead has long preferred vignettes of intellectual mediocrity posing as legitimate social commentary.","gets really boring, really fast",1405555200,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Best adventure game ever?  I'm boggled by the reviews.  I'm a world-class cheapskate, and I'll finish any game just to say I got my money's worth, but this thing is just insufferable.
Let's take a look at the blow-by-blow:
1. But it's got gorgeous graphics -- Ok, the scenery's pretty.  Know what?  So was the scenary in Myst, and that suckers a good 5+ years older than TLJ.  And let's keep in mind that when people are raving about the graphics, they're referring to the SCENERY; if it moves in the game (i.e. the characters), then its blocky and clunky.  I've seen better quality in full motion video games than the character models in this thing.
2. The voice acting -- Yeah, it's good, which indeed is a rarity these days.  I must confess that I found the main character annoying after a while, but the voice acting was certainly top-notch.  But what good is voice acting when . . . .
3. They never shut up -- That's right.  Never.  Never ever.  And every time you meet a character, you're going to find these enourmous dialogue trees, with layers on layers of their childhood, their sexual proclivities, their hopes, their dreams, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.  And, in true adventure game style, you never know which little bit is going to yield that crucial bit of information that you need to progress the game.  So you sit and you listen and you pray for death to come.
4. The story is just lame -- Maybe I just have a chip on my shoulder, but what kind of hippie, new age, gobbledy-gook is this?  What was the writer smoking?  I'm quite forgiving, particularly in the realm of sci-fi and fantasy, but this thing is just trite and uninspiring.  My favorite thing about the game is that it'll put some outlandish rule out there, which normally I'd just accept without thinking, but then they try and EXPLAIN it, and it makes no sense.  For example:
  * Crazy outlandish rule -- So there needs to be a new Guardian every 1000 years.
  * Me -- Gotcha.  1000 years.  New Guardian.  Check
  * Expository character who can't stop rambling -- Oh but there's a good reason for the 1000 year cap: the soul can't be separated from the body for longer than that.
  * Me -- HUH?!?!?!
5. It's still all the annoyances of adventure gameplay -- To top it all off, you're still going to be bogged down in the apparently unbreakable rules of an adventure game:
  A) If you know what you need, but you can't find it, examine every stinking thing in your inventory 'cause it's probably hidden inside something else
  B) If you know you need to use something in a specific way, but it just doesn't seem to work, you probably simply haven't placed the object in PRECISELY the right spot to trigger the action
  C) When all else fails, spend half and hour blindly trying to combine items in your inventory, and waving inventory items across the screen.  With any luck, you'll stumble across the completely unintuitive Rube-Goldbergian contraption/technique that the game's designers decided was the only possible way to open a window.  If you're less lucky, it means you don't have the right item, so go revisit every location and try to pick up everything you can.  Once you've got something new, repeat blind inventory combining and/or waving until you're allowed to proceed to the next 20 minute monologue on the Balance and the Disc and the Key which is the Disc which has been broken into four which are the keys of the Disc for the Balance.

Then you have the DLC's, and the only one I had luck with was Old World Blues where the game only froze on me 2 times, but 2 of the other DLC's had the same freezing issues, if not worse than the main game, in one of the DLCs I had the game freeze every 30 minutes. Then you have the horrible DLC that breaks the game, Lonesome Road, once you get outside about an hour into the DLC it lags horribly and freezes only after a few minutes of playing, I've literally had the game freeze after playing for only 2 minutes of that DLC. I think I'm going to just give up, the game was horribly optimized for this console and to be honest the game isn't that great anyway, but if you must play it get it on 360 or an optimized PC, and if you must play it on PS3 get the regular edition and install all the DLC separately. I played Oblivion, Fallout 3, and Skyrim all on PS3 and put 100s of hours into those games combine, beat almost all the content and side material, and even went through Shivering Isles on Oblivion. I only had maybe a handful of issues on those games compared to this version of New Vegas, and I can count Skyrim only freezing up on me a handful of times, and even Oblivion and Fallout 3 which were plagued with issues and freezing probably only froze a quarter the amount of times this game did total and I played those games probably double or triple the amount of time I played this.

 I could have maybe forgiven the game if it only froze 10 times the whole experience and if all the DLC ran smooth with no issues, but the only thing in the game that ran somewhat smooth for me was Old World Blues and that may have just been out of luck, the game is a buggy mess and becomes more frustrating than fun when you have to either quit out or turn off your system after every hour or so because the game freezes and lags, and the fact that there is an entire DLC on this that is practically unplayable is unacceptable and Bethesda should be ashamed of this port, and the people who tested this and gave it the green light should feel ashamed of themselves. Clearly this port didn't have the PS3's specs in mind so they tried to cut corners and wing it, and as a result we got a buggy port that can barely run for more than an hour at time before encountering an issue. And anyone who gave this more than 3 stars probably never played this version and are rating the core game, which itself would be around 4 stars, that or they didn't play for more than 10-15 hours when the big issues start popping up, because I bet if they went into Lonesome Road this game would have a much lower rating average. I'm not even really a huge PC gamer, but for this game, PC is the best experience and way to go if you want the least issues.","Please don't buy this, this version is practically unplayable and one DLC is broken",1505606400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Maintanance workers are pointless, literally. There area no tour guides in this one; there's anal-retentive ""Educators"" that despite taking up little space visually, they demand a large area around them.

You get in-game alerts (an intended cruel joke courtesy of the game creators) for various things the game deems important. OH MY GOD. IT DOESN'T EVER STOP. Most of the alerts will SPAM RAPIDLY that zookeeper so-and-so can't reach the poo or food dish despite it being easily accessible.

About 20% of the time the servers were unnavailable even though the website said they were fine it was always the ""Authentication Severs"" having issues.  Anyway, the game is very repititious and you pretty much are forced to buy items through the in game auction house to outfit your character well, instead of being able to get good equipment on your own.  So I quit playing.  I just decided the other day that I would play again since I never actually finished the game.

I hate this game. My copy from amazon would not work (not fault on Amazon's part most likely) so I bought another copy from Gamestop and I am regretting it all the way. I want to set this cartridge on fire.

If you're looking for a game to fill a hole in your heart that Bravely Default left, after completing every possible thing you can in it, keep looking. This game is grindy to the point that I find it unbearable. I am SHOCKED it has 5 star review on amazon. I spent 3 hours trying to grind to get past the second map that I went to explore and I *STILL* cannot clear the boss there. AND THERE IS NO OPTION TO RUN FROM THE BOSS?!?!!?! If it's one you accidentally run on you should be able to flee. Seeing as how you lose ALL EXPLORED MAP PROGRESS if you die, running around to grind or explore and running into a boss and getting your tushy handed to you and not being able to get away from it is cruel.

I looked it up to see what else I could do to make it less hard. I love grindy games. I love Diablo, I played Ragnarok Online for YEARS and WoW for even more. But I hate this game. The random level up system is awful. The battle system is sub-par at best. The best thing it has going for it is the ridiculously too large breasts on Eloise which I find not entirely necessary (and I draw porn for a living so that's saying something).

I am so disappointed in this game. I am disappointed in Atlus. After how great Bravely Default was I didn't expect to hate this game so much.

As I am a fan of the old colonization, I was thrilled to see it come back to life, though under the Civ4 cover. I even pre-ordered it to have right from the start. Since I do not own Civilization4, I have no way of comparing the two games and can not draw from experience from Civ4.

Unfortunately the documentation in the manual and the help in the game itself are insufficient to answer my questions. Here a few points that ruin the overall rating and should be addressed in a patch ASAP, since it will make the game much more accessible for new players.

-In the game setup, the effect of one's choice of the game speed is not explained. (I.E. Marathon = higher cost of materials for building, more gold needed for purchases, more storage in settlements and most important - more turns until the deadline)

-In the diplomacy menu, the names of the native leaders mean nothing to me - the tribe name would help! It makes for ""fun"" diplomacy if you have to go back and forth to figure who is who and where on the map they are.

-I can't see how many turns I have to wait for my ""Expert Farmer"" to be done in the native village (yes, I do have that progress bar, but I saw it full for 10 marathon-turns and still no farmer) What if I have multiple students in the village?

-How does the education system work? Sometimes it takes 20 turns for a graduate, or 115, there is no information whatsoever on what influences the training time. If you only have a set number of turns, would you not want to know what you need to do to get specialists faster? I do!

-How do I train veteran soldiers? In the old game my soldiers would eventually get the veteran status if they fought enough battles. So far no veterans here.

There is no information about the other players, the options of interaction are very limited an make them very plain.

Somehow the AI must be confused. Here I had Spain ask for help and push for war with a native tribe(who only had 2 villages). A few turns later they declared war without my help and, behold, the natives nearly wipe them out in ONE TURN. All major Spanish settlements - gone! Just 3 Colonists in 2 settlements left. Odd!

Some of the benefits of the founding fathers are not clear. What is a ""50% faster production of Church, Cathedral"" mean? 50% faster construction? 50% more crosses? Some hard to get to founding fathers only offer a lousy one time bonus (like John Paul Jones).

On a preferential note, I find the game too short. In normal speed the game is plainly frustrating! In no time the ""Just 100 more turns"" pops up. Fortunately Marathon saved it for me.

The royal army is insanely HUGE! Even if most of my colonists are made into soldiers it is much bigger then anything I can field - and I was playing at the lowest difficulty setting!

The world is disappointingly small! Set on the ""HUGE"" setting one stumbles over the other Europeans within the first few turns.

-The subtitles are impossible to read because they are so small and white and they blend in with the scene. This causes you to miss important information because you can't understand what they're talking about.

-Side quests are usually one of my favorite parts to open world games, but the side quests in this game were almost impossible to either reach or complete, nothing is fun about reaching a Side quest location and then being attacked by 50 redcoats just because you walked in the area. The viewpoints are often impossible to reach because they are in trees and tree climbing never works. You start in one place and you end up falling or you just stand there unable to jump further.

-The combat can be extremely simple or extremely difficult whenever it feels like it. Sometimes you can beat up guys with combos with ease and other times no matter what combo you attempt doesn't work.

-What type of game thinks it's a good idea for you to stab the AEI multiple times see the blood and yet they keep getting up, that is ridiculous. These fights are more repetitive then the ones in assassins creed. I'm also not a fan of a game that thrusts you into different scenarios without explaining what you're supposed to do. This forces you to repeat the same stupid parts over and over again.

-The camera jumps around at the worst times possible so when you're ready to do an important test like assassinate someone from behind you can't see what that you're doing. The button controls are almost completely different from the previous games why is the synchronize button B instead of button Y?

As for the review,

I would like to point out, the audio of when I pull out the R/L channels seems to have fixed itself in the recording, but in live time the audio was actually messing up on the computer side live, not recorded.
The card itself does does work. I tried composite and component, but worked however the card itself is where the issue lies. Whatever encoder or software inside of the capture card, it is causing the issue of really, really! Really bright colors and missing colors. Composite was fine, however the screen was shaking and jittering around. So let me clarify the device does work but not the way it should or at least my device anyway. I'm willing to try out another device or take a refund but to anyone else save yourself the cash and go get the Diamond Multimedia Component Capture Card for 49$ or the Roxio HD for 54$. It's a shame either are expensive since it's component but I guess that is what you get when you go cheap.

*Any positive reviews on the product are false and misleading, most likely companies trying to make the product look good to grab money.*

Pros:

- Worked
- Small
- Component
- Can use output as long as you have another pair of cables

Cons:

- Doesn't work correctly
- Hissing, audio distortion and buzzing, bending of the audio
- Very cheap quality
- Painful to set up via Computer
- Imitation (Copycat) of Diamond Multimedia and Roxio software
- Constantly has issues, the software has a mind of its own. (Was changing the settings by itself)

So if I could 0/5 but I can't so 1/5. This capture card is pure garbage. Part of me was hoping this product would work but I guess you get what you pay for.",Possibly the worst Item on Amazon,1420502400,,,

Surprisingly,the CPU A.I. is non-existent anyway! Sure,because poker is often a game of luck, you won't win every game. I just played the Texas Hold'em portion of the game for about 20 minutes at the store but that was enough. The tournaments for Texas hold'em are limited to only 20 hands or so(very similar format to Hoyle Casino 2004 for the computer,but at least that was structured better).The one with the most money after 20 hands wins.

So when I saw the sequel on the store shelf I thought to myself that it would probably have all those flaws improved upon while still keeping it's great strategy elements.  So I bought the game hoping to be able to live out my favorite scenes from the Godfather.  At first the game was amusing, but after those quick 10 minutes, the game was quickly repackaged and returned!
First off, the strategy elements of the game are completely gone!  Everyone used to complain about the micro-management in the first, so I guess the solution was to completely erase all management. You're basically told what business to buy and it just generates money.
The graphics are a bit cartoonish, but fitting.  Although the graphics aren't realistic or polygonal they match the theme of the game and give it the appropriate feel.  Unfortunately, that's all this game has!  Good looks, good packaging, no substance!
The gameplay is terrible!  You'll pull your hair out as you order your goons to drive two blocks away and watch him circle around the whole neighborhood before finally going to his destination... and hopefully he's not there to do a drive-by!  The drive-by shootings in this game are just ridiculous.  You'll quickly despise watching your thugs drive past, shoot, make a U-turn, drive back, shoot more, make another U-turn, shoot (you get the point).  That doesn't seem like a very effective drive-by to me.  Also, the people standing on the side walk never EVER take cover, they just stand there shooting at the car until they are FINALLY gunned down.  What kind of dumb gangsters are these anyway?  The AI definately needs improving!  Also, don't get your car ruined.  If you do, then you have the option of stealing your enemies car, but only HIS car.  What sense does this make?  My thugs have no problem with gunning down police officers but they refuse to steal an innocent person's car.  I had to run 4 blocks (past rows and rows of perfectly good parked cars) to my enemies hideout to steal his vehicle.  But basically what I am saying is that the AI in the game is pretty stupid.
Another thing that ruins the gameplay is the tedious and repetative missions.  The game is basically open this shop, do a hit on this guy, buy that building, place guards here, do a hit on that guy... over and over and over again.  And although carrying out a ""hit"" should normally be enjoyable, as you can tell from my paragraph above I found killing people to be quite the chore.
So if all of the micro-management is now non-existant and all of the action is absolutely horrendous and silly, what does this game have to offer?  Simply put... boredom.  The game is just too easy, too simple, and too shallow.  Perhaps for the third game they should eliminate the tedious missions and make it more open-ended.  Just allow you to hire thugs and build your empire.  Also, they need to work on that AI a little.  Why do these guys get lost in a neighborhood that's 5 blocks wide?  And who ever heard of circling back around, better yet, making a U-turn while doing a drive-by?  You're supposed to shoot and then high tail it outta there!  Basically, it could have been a good game had they taken the time out to actually add some gameplay to it.","Terrible, terrible game!",993772800,11,,

I started in the NES era, but I'll skip to the point. I have owned the following in order: xbox, ps2, xbox 360, traded that broken 360 for a ps3, bought an xbox360 elite, sold my ps3, and bought an Xbox One, Currently own a 360 elite and a One. I have swapped from Xbox preference to Ps3, but have never had a strong argument against either. In my opinion, anyone that does is just immature and wants to argue. The 360 and PS3 are both excellent consoles, and there is nothing that makes one indisputably better than the other.

That said, I would have gotten a Ps4 if they were available based on price, hardware, controller preference, and Microsoft's original terms which were flat out disturbing. I'm aware they changed them, but that has caused problems of it's own and left a bad taste in my mouth. Anyway, here's my breakdown, cons first. (I am writing this review as a comparison between the 360 and One, not as the One as a stand alone device. This is because a company should only get credit for a new version if it is actually better than the previous)

-KINECT

Cons
We'll start with the obvious. The questionable decision to force the gimmicky kinect on consumers. When I made the decision to go with Xbox, I was under the impression that surely Microsoft had made vast improvements with the peripheral. With so much time to work on it, I figured the voice functionality would be extremely refined and maybe even a little intelligent. What I ended up with was Kinect that was indistinguishable from it's predecessor in terms of functionality. Frankly, it sucks. It sucked on the 360, and it sucks every bit as much on xb1. I still find myself yelling ""Xbox play.. XBOX PLAY... XBOX PLA-oh, there it goes..."". I usually end up yelling at it until I get frustrated and then picking up the controller that was sitting next to me the whole time. In need for speed, it comes in really handy when instructing your gps to route for you. If they had segregated it to this, maybe tie it into the story mentioning a voice operated gps, then it would have been excellent. Instead I end up getting 360 rotations of my view, or pulling up the map mid race, half of the time when I'm not even saying anything. It also just went dead for dead rising, which allows you to stomp and elbow zombies off you. Was a lot of fun, til one day it just stopped registering. No amount of trouble shooting could bring it back and I eventually traded the game.

Pros
You can pause and play movies, and go to the XB home without using a remote.. anything else is risky and will achieve mixed results and lots of frustration.

-XBOX DOESN'T WANT ME TO HAVE ANY FRIENDS
So I'm playing need for speed rivals, loving it, but I've already got OP cars and half a mil in the bank. I decide it's time to get into multiplayer. Little did I know the barriers that microsoft had put in place to prevent any social interaction from taking place. My first attempt to make contact was via message. Please excuse the PS3 harping, but that was my most recent console. On my last gen PS3, if I wanted to message someone or send a friend request I could simply pull up the players met list, select the player, and choose how I wanted to interact. If I'm not mistaken, the 360 was just as easy. You can imagine my amazement when my latest and greatest next gen console could not provide this simple service. I could not find any way to message or add a friend without exiting the game, jumping through some hoops, and manually entering their user name. You shouldn't need a pen and a pad to send a message to someone you are in a game with. I was able to find a method of adding them in game, by pulling up the dpad menu, selecting players, and viewing their gamer card. If this works, you can send a message from there. Unfortunately, it doesn't work. I suspect that Microsoft's default privacy settings prevent this, but it's hard to tell when the ""error"" message says something as stupid as ""sorry, we don't know what went wrong!"". As a last resort, I had to turn to what every introvert gamer hates, the Mic. I was actually excited just to make contact with someone and race around together. But no, Microsoft shafts me again. The controller tethered mic that comes with the system will not give me audio, will show that it pics up voice, but due to the Kinect mic I was unable to determine which one was actually picking me up. I tried it on two controllers, I troubleshot, I was able to mute and hear the volume increase from the headset, I tried party chats, nothing. On top of that, XB1 doesn't support my 200 dollar XB360 headset. Needless to say, voice chat was not an option as it was too difficult yelling at my tv and listening through my speakers. So now, I am literally left with one option.. keep a pen and paper next to me so that I can add friends on my ""next gen"" console. You can read someone else's review to hear about the awesome ""party"" system, I'm done with this.

-INTERFACE AND FUNCTIONALITY
Cons
So I never understood at any point how the XBox was supposed to be this one stop entertainment hub, connecting your entire household of devices to one smooth interface.. or whatever it was pitched as. I don't really see any improvement over either last gen console, in fact I liked both better. It's nice that the XBox will turn on my tv, but it's basically just activating the power button, so it has no idea if the TV is already on or off. It matters more than you think when you're laying in bed and realize the console is still running. You can't say ""Xbox turn off TV"" either. It flat out can't pick up my soundbar at all, even if I manually configure, and the remote just broke, so I have to get up to turn sound on and off. One of the worst things, my 200 dollar PS3/XB360 compatible headset will not work with XBoxOne and there is no adapter. Yeah, really tying all my devices together well Microsoft.. There is an app that lets you use tablets and smartphones in game, but I don't see why any console couldn't do that. I never end up using them because you have to stop playing the game in order to do so. All the multimedia stuff just doesn't do a lot for me.. I really just need my apps.

The interface is not very intuitive, there seems to be no ""back"" button, which has been the standard, and I just don't really like the way it's organized. There's something about how everything constantly changes that makes me feel I can't get my barrings. On the left, you've got all your pin stuff, which shifts when new items are added and can only be reorganized by individually ""move to front"" commands. Then in the center, you've got the centerpiece which shows an animation of whatever you are currently running, which is fine, but then the bottom 4 or 5 tiles constantly rotate our your recent apps. Then you have a thin bar to the right which is static. So basically, the vast majority of the interface home is constantly swapping out, changing, and moving. It's a little disorienting and annoying. I liked the 360 and PS3 interfaces much better, however not having to leave a game to change settings is a huge plus.

Pros
You can multitask easily. Game DVR is probably my single favorite improvement, that is pretty cool. Changing settings without exiting game. Lots of apps, including free Kinect Fitness with things like P90X, Insanity, and Jillian Michaels. That's a nice bonus. Other than that, I didn't see much difference between last gen other than less intuitive and more messy interface.

-Performance/Graphics

Pros/Cons
Not much to say here. They are better than last gen, but not mind blowing. I do have 2 complaints. One, that the load times seem long. Trying to spawn in front of a racer in need for speed is often a lost cause because they will be gone before you finish loading. Maybe they seem long just for that reason, hard to say. The other is the obvious, that PS4 is said to have 50% more graphics processing power. I actually haven't played a PS4, but the numbers don't sound good. I've heard there is little functional difference, but I will have to see for myself. The games do look really good, but that's expected, they still look great on last gen.

Conclusion

My big gripe with the XBox One is that aside from hardware, it just isn't any better than the 360. The 360 allows me to do a number of things that my Xb1 does not, and that is unacceptable. It's supposed to be this media hub power house, yet it fails with the most important things. My sound bar doesn't sync, my headset is incompatible, their headset is broken, I can't interact socially, and I'd have to buy my PS3 back if I wanted to watch a 3D movie. To add insult to injury, the Kinect is just as gimmicky, disfunctional, and intrusive as ever. Shame on you Microsoft, shame on you.","It has better graphics than the 360, but everything else is worse, and Microsoft doesn't want me to have any friends.",1391040000,15,,

Even if I think the game isn't that fun, I still try to stick with it to give a full comprehensive review.  This game, however, I just couldn't bring myself to do it.  As my title suggests, the main reason I couldn't do it was the combat system.

When I first loaded the game I thought the opening sequence took far too long.  I was afraid this game was going to be trying way too hard to be cinematic.  Sometimes this works out well, but other times it's just overdone.  I feel like ""Headhunter: Redemption"" is overdone.  When I was first playing around with the controls I thought you could do some pretty cool stuff with your character.  When I first used the combat system I didn't think it would be that much of a detriment.  Then I went into live combat...

Basically the aiming reticule moves around like your hands are shaking uncontrollably.  Even when your character is standing still it does this.  Now, I've fired guns in real life, I can hold my hand far more still than this game.  You spend most of your time aiming all over the place waiting for the ""auto aim"" to lock onto the target.  If you're moving this is ten times more difficult.  And yes, you have to use this functionality because you have to hold down the trigger to go into the aiming mode then hit ""A"" if you want to actually fire the gun.  It's stupid and I hate it.

A way to balance the dysfunctional combat would be to have health packs all over the place or make your character invincible to enemy bullets.  Neither of these is true and the latter is usually absurd in a video game as standard functionality.  There are health packs, but they don't work the same way in other games.  They're more like medkits that you pick up and then you have to ""equip"" them in a totally different screen.  So, if you're in a major fire fight there's nothing you can really do about it, but die.  There's no health you will run over and it will automatically heal you, you have to stop and go into that other screen.  Granted the game pauses when you do this, but it disrupts the combat elements so much that getting back into it could be a death sentence in the long run.

To paraphrase:  We do not guarantee the ability to actually be able to play the game.  That tells you all you need to know about the online at all times requirement.

In many ways Diablo 3 reminds me of some disappointments I had with Dungeon Siege 3.  There's the system that awards a player with every skill by the time a certain level is attained.  Gone are the days where you had a stable of characters each with their own specialization.  There's the system that automatically assigns stat points, another aspect that will be the same every time you play the game.  The only way to modify stat points is via item attributes.  Levels that are tight corridors.  While still fun in their own way all of these things detracted from the replay value of Dungeon Siege 3.  It was a play it a few times game and then forget it because you already knew which skills you'd end up with and what stats you'd have before you even started your second playthrough.  The exact same ones you had the last time.  Diablo 3 suffers the same fate, it's not going to last 12 years like its predecessor because there is no depth in character uniqueness.

The game is also shorter.  Sure, you can play it over again at a higher difficulty but it's still disappointing to have to play the exact same levels three times over to arrive at a decent target time for what should have been the time it takes to play through the game once.

With the online requirement that perpetually threatens playing time (and restricts play on my terms) and a severely shortened replay value I found it difficult to justify the initial price tag.  For what it is this game should have been much, much cheaper at launch.  I would say wait for a price drop but this is Blizzard.  You'll be waiting a long time for that.

I was enjoying the original Fallout 3 game too much, but the down loadable contents(DLC) were too glitchy to try again.
Now with a new company making the new installment, I hoped that the quality of the game would be better.  NO IT DIDN'T.  It's basically Fallout 3 with additional glitches that are too much to enjoy.  What is worst is that the glitches are so bad that it CORRUPTS saves.  So forget about continuing your progress, since they won't mean anything.

If you still want to purchase the game, then DON'T PURCHASE THE GAME for this console.  The Xbox 360 has a timed exclusive like Fallout 3.  Also, once the DLCs were available for the PS3 users, the DLCs were filled with glitches that were NEVER PATCHED.

(Review of the game)
It's just one giant DLC.  Almost every part of the game is the same as Fallout 3.  The only differences are just the small details.  New additional weapons, trees, Vegas.  There are some good parts of the game, but there are just too much of the last game in this game that it's really not a new game.

It's much more harder than the last Fallout 3 game.  They went back to the original leveling up sequence from Fallout 1 and 2 where you can only get a perk after leveling up a few times, instead of leveling up every time.  Now you can get two more companions at the same time.  One is a living person and the other is a machine or mechanical one. Also, for Fallout 2 fans, this game does mention the tribal descendant, vault dweller as well as his/her's super mutant companion.  Arefu remind you of anything.

I rented this damn game, and, based on my experience, didn't taking advantage of Black Friday deals where this game was marked down to $34.99.  The game is just so badly made that I didn't want to help top this game as a best-seller.  As a PS3 owner, this time exclusives are worthless.

While it's true that the arcade Ikari Warriors is considered a ""classic"", I don't quite think that term applies to this ramshackle NES port.

Ikari Warriors sports an overhead, birds-eye view, as the screen scrolls vertically. However, it has one of the most repetitve design schemes I've ever seen, both in backgrounds and enemies. You'll begin in the jungle and, after what seems like an eternity, you'll move onto more space-age fortresses. The objects and characters are all rather small and flat. For the most part, the enemies are the same little blue soldiers over and over again. Occasionally, a green one or a pink one, or one carrying a shield will show up. (It's kind of funny how they float away like a leaf when you shoot them.) The player characters are meant to look like ""Rambo"", but they appear overweight, and the animation of their walk is stilted. When walking from left-to-right, the legs move as though they are a pair of scissors. There are many objects to blow up along the way, but it's sometimes difficult to tell what they are supposed to be. The tanks look really flat, and aren't much of a step up from the tanks in the Atari 2600 game, ""Combat"". The helicopters and some of the architecture, such as the stone faces, do look a bit more realistic. The backgrounds may be okay for a game made in 1986, but the stages are REALLY long, and the pattern pretty much repeats for the entire stage. By the time you reach the 4th or 5th checkpoint that looks exactly the same as all the others, you'll wonder if you've even made any progress. I also find the liberal usage of the color ""pink"" somewhat peculiar. The game's title is written in pink letters. The Player One commando wears a pink bandana and has a pink gun. The tanks are pink. The power-up items are pink. Some of the enemy soldiers are clad in pink. Some objects have flashing pink skulls on them. Even the explosions are pink! It's almost as though they were unable to locate the color ""red"" on the NES's color palette. Although its graphics may be nondescript and repetitive, Ikari Warriors does have its moments. For example, the boss at the end of Level 3 just needs to be seen, and the usage of colors in the final level is psychadelic.

Ikari Warriors has one song that plays for the entire game and only changes when you reach a checkpoint or boss. Both songs are somewhat irritating, but it probably wouldn't be so bad if the levels weren't so extremely long and the music didn't repeat so much. The sound effects are not really all that good, either. The bullets sound nothing like real gunfire, and when someone gets hit you hear an effect that goes ""bump"". It's not that Ikari Warriors' sound is agonizingly bad...it's just very boring.

Ikari Warriors has some of the worst play control I've ever dealt with. The characters are incredibly sluggish and unresponsive. The game does have speed-ups, but even when you have the super speed-up, the characters still move way too slow! This makes any form of dodging that there should be in a game like this completely non-existant. It's impossible to avoid taking hits, and this is a ""one-hit-and-you're-dead"" game. This has the effect of making the game unplayable without use of a cheat code. The screen scrolls really slowly, too. (The arcade version of Ikari Warriors had automatic scrolling, the NES version does not.) It's almost impossible to aim. My character just spins in circles as I try to line up my shots with the enemies, without much luck. The movement controls for the tanks are better, but aiming is even worse, and you never have the tanks for that long. Because of the poor control and slow movement, it takes forever to get through the immensely long levels.

There really isn't much of a plot behind Ikari Warriors. You play as a couple of commandos whose plane has been shot down by the enemy. But we do not know who these enemies are, what their motivation is, or even where this is taking place. I have heard some accounts say that the game is set in Vietnam during the war era, but that doesn't explain why Levels 3 and 4 look more space-age and some enemies in those levels appear ""alien"" in nature. There isn't any real atmosphere since the characters all look too silly to be taken seriously.
CHALLENGE: 1/10
Ikari Warriors did not receive a low challenge score because it's easy. It received a low score because it's a bad game that's horribly unplayable. When a game is as unplayable as this, there is no challenge. You cannot dodge and can barely control where you shoot. The gameplay is the same repetitive thing throughout all four of its excessively long and boring stages. The only way to make any progress is to use the A,B,B,A code to keep continuing. And if you're going to do that, then you could just as well keep marching straight ahead and not worry about stopping to fight things.

Ikari Warriors is definitely a contender for ""worst game I've ever played"". The levels are too long, slow, and boring. The only things that pass for ""level design"" are objects placed in your way to make you go even slower. It's practically impossible to really do anything besides walk forward and die evey 5-20 steps. There are lots of different power-up things you can find, but none of them do much to help. To add further insult to injury, Ikari Warriors is very glitchy, and it's because of these flaws that it's often possible to get stuck on Level 3. In a section right before the final boss area, the commando can become stuck behind a wall, unable to move on. There is no way out of this. Even if he gets hit and dies, he reappears in the exact same spot, still stuck behind the wall. It's very frustrating to trudge through three very long levels, only to get stuck on Level 3 and have to reset. I'm also not sure why the designers made it so that you have to do something unusual and not very obvious to get past the end of Level 3 after beating the boss. Very little of IW's design makes any sense.

I can't think of too many good things to say about Ikari Warriors. If you're into collecting NES games, you may want to pick it up, if only to see the bizarre ""boss"" at the end of level 3. Just keep in mind that it's a very bad game with practically no play value of any sort.","If you're into collecting NES games, you may want to pick it up, if only to see the bizarre ""boss"" at the end of level 3",1428710400,4,,

The story is visceral and engaging but not for the faint of heart.  Much of the imagery is disturbing and gruesome.  What was there was pretty well done for an initial release, but there just wasn't much there.  I was just getting the feel for the game when the campaign/single player ended.  I was in shock as it was only my second session with the game, meaning I finished it in under 5 hours.

At this point I moved on to the online campaign.  After selecting XBox Live I was prompted for to purchase or redeem an online code.  What?!  I just bought the game why would I need a code.  Its not a PC, its a console, this is odd.  But sure enough I found in my game case the required online access code.  Without this code you can only play up to level 5 in multiplayer.

So with a 5 hour campaign and a required code to play online this game is going to be a real bummer for anyone who buys it used.  They will have to pay to be able to play it online.  If there are multiple people in your house with different Live accounts, they will each have to buy their own code.  This is the most absurd thing I have ever seen with a console game.  With all the compromises that I deal with for console gaming, the one thing I expect is a level of trust that I am not stealing the game, but apparently that is now gone too.

A couple of other pet peeves with this game.  The game would have been even shorter if I had not had to sit and wait seemingly forever for the NPCs to open a door and walk through it, at times right after a checkpoint so that you get to enjoy it multiple times if you die.  That is even if you know exactly where to go and what to do, you have to wait for the NPC to open the door and saunter through it, and then the next NPC to follow before you can then walk through the door.  If you try to go earlier you just get in the way, are not allowed to proceed and slow the progress of the NPC, and ultimately your own progress.  Another annoyance was points of infinite spawns in the game where if you attempted to pre-clear an area you would never finish, had I just moved up at first try the game would have been even shorter and I would have had more ammo.  Finally, there is a sniper mission where you must wait for the NPC to identify the target, and finally give you the OK to fire.  If you shoot anytime before the final OK, you will have to restart the mission.

Now that it's been a couple of weeks I can safely say that I would recommend this game to no one, not even another die hard FF fan.

1. They refuse to activate the AH for reasons unknown. Instead, they are going to rename these terrible market wards where zombie NPCs stand around selling your wares, ten slots at a time. It's a horrible system, with no way to search for items that you need.

2. The User Interface is horrible. Every action is laggy, and in Beta we all thought it was because the UI was server side for debugging purposes. Either they are still debugging it, or it really is just this bad. Either way, it doesn't belong in a paid release of the game. Forget about customizing it as well - they already sent a Cease and Desist letter to the developers of the third-party add on called Windower.

Commentary was padded out a bit, but they should be trying to super-expand commentary every year with more stories and more situational things to say. It's not acceptable to hear the same line repeated multiple times in a single game. That's not at all ""next-gen"" in my book.

Doc & Eddie are the most annoying and nasal commentators ever, and it's not only just how they sound, but also in what they say. Lots of redundant and awkward comments like ""kitty cornered to the corner"" and ""its over. the game is over."" and ""he hit somebody."" just the stupidest things I've ever heard any commentary say. NHL14 commentary was a great base and they should have just expanded it.

We still don't have any more options to modify our game experience than we did years ago. The sliders stay pretty much the same. The in-game option to disable the feedback window still hasn't been implemented.

BAP needs some in-game cutscenes for different activities, like the gym, school, practice, and they should also start trying to make BAP be more of a drama with a girl who likes you and maybe encourages you to play your best each game to win her affection (lol). Who says it has to be a pure hockey game every single year? EA needs to start expanding the hockey game experience to include the different social aspects and challenges surrounding it, including romance, school, etc. Right now all we have are a few buttons to push and sliders to indicate how much we're liked by fans, family, team, and management. That's pure laziness on EA's part. They just rest back on their laurels year after year because they know they've got a guaranteed income from doing just a few tweaks and trying to up-sell them as major advancements in their product.

There are no random events that can occur, which greatly reduces replayability. Any genius game or A.I. designer should know that it's programming in random irrational behaviors that makes things feel less like a computer and more like a living world where anything can happen. The refs should be possible to knock over, coaches should be able to get mad and run onto the ice, a play may fall suddenly ill and need to leave, a fight may break out in the crowd, an obsessive fan may be present at a game every now and then -- pounding on the glass and yelling things at specific players, maybe security takes him away, or ignores him for most of the game.

Still no love for the girls. While FIFA is expanding their game with female teams and leagues, there's still no sign of NWHL presence in the NHL series. It would be good to have just for diversity and to help get more girls interested in playing these games.

There are other things I could bring up, but the main point is that EA could and should be doing a lot more to further their hockey franchise than they have been doing. I jumped in at NHL14 (since SNES days) and while NHL14 is a great experience and I love BAP, the last 2 installments have shown me just how slow their idea of progress is. They need to work on their cinematics, presentation, kick out and find new commentators (imo), plus lots of other things. For NHL16 it seems they have a solid gameplay down from puck physics to skate physics and physical interaction between everything.

This game is GARBAGE! The nrs devs keep making the grind harder with each patch. The new legendary multiverse requires unrealistic goals for anyone with a life. Look it up..its unfair requirements are for 1 piece of gear(>_<)one! The latest patch 1.10 will delete unlocked shaders, and shaders you bought.. and in many cases ALL your gear and abilities!! I lost 100 pieces of gear and all my recently purchased shaders from patch 1.09! I had to call Sony to get my money back! Also the new raiden dlc was CLEARLY seen as a chance for these liberal devs to mock President Donald Trump. Its very distasteful! Black Lightning says things like ""thats an alternative fact"", and ""thats fake news"". I'm not even kidding look up his dialogue. I bought the deluxe edition because I enjoyed the 1st game. The devs are using this as a platform to voice their distain for The President, push social justice warrior propaganda throught DLC characters, and rip off fans with source Crystal exploits for premier skins and shaders! This is the worst game yet from nrs. I am so angry that they rather take shots at THE President Donald Trump, than fix the source Crystal microtransaction exploit that prevents us from unlocking ALL shaders with hardwork. If you buy this game you will be exposed to liberal garbage opinions, instead of a well balanced game! I'm an independent voter that didn't vote(I was a Bernie or Bust guy) and this has me wishing I voted Trump. It's so childish to make us pay for this dialogue that has NOTHING to do with DC comics. I am a profile lvl 80 and ranked 800 across the board; So take it from me as a Top 10% player this game is not worth your money. At NRS they want to make statements NOT games! Do yourself a favor and stay away.

Plays just like a movie! Tons of fantastic
moves, and a genuinely fantastic game! The worst part is the people playing this game. Very poor morals, bad online sportsmanship, and a general lack of respect. Just play offline unless you like showing them who's boss. The gear suffers from random grind drops and greed. Source crystals are exploited. They are nearly impossible to get past leveling up..even then you only get 200max. You need 4000 to but shaders and 6000 to unlock premier skins. Not cool. This game is going to be very expensive to complete! Well over $150 if you get all skins and characters. I have the ultimate edition. I got it early and got a free shirt to boost! It was a very good early release event!

I was able to find out through the gamer grapevine and industry grapevine what a piece of garbage this software was going to be.  Then I watched the install and playing of this game on a friend's computer to verify what I've heard, and yes it is true as stated by numerous other reviewers here.

I won't waist my time and yours repeating what has already been said.  But yes Blizzard makes you jump through many hoops and then tightens the hoops around your neck.  They treat the paying public like criminals who buy their products and who made their company.  I have a comment about that, ""don't bite the hand that feeds you.""  The large price for a game that is only 1/3 complete with only the terrain part of the game, and the fact that you have to be connected to the internet to play the game, to get any more maps, and to get your game saves/stats, etc.  Also, you can never reset your account it is the same for life unless you pay for another copy of the game, plus you can only play with people in your region, period.  And yes, one must be connected to the internet to play the full installed version of the game.  If you are not connected the game does not have full features.  AND every 4 weeks you must connect to your online account or your game will shut down, and that's for the life of the game.  Also, the Blizzard server saves and compiles data and all your stats from the game whether you want it or not; and it stays as part of your account for the life of your game and you can not change or reset it without buying another copy of the game.  Also, for small extra online addons here and there you will pay and pay again if you want them.

All this sounds great huh?  This is borderline criminal if not criminal.  It is apparent that this industry needs to be caught up to modern times with some form of regulation.  The consumer needs privacy and protection from this kind of crap.  Phone companies can not listen in on your calls just because they made the phone, and car companies can not track you and tell you to drive the car to their home office every month so they can make sure you are doing the right thing with the car.

I think its best to stay away from this game and this company.  I will not ever buy anymore of their so called products.  And they are now releasing Diablo 3 that will be just like this.  Don't make me laugh.

I write this as a warning to those who don't know what this company is doing.  Don't waist your money.  Save yourself the hassle, the headaches, and the aggravation.  Again, I count myself lucky that I did not throw my money down the hole called Blizzard.

Now about ODST, it offers a 4-6 hours long campaing which is poor compared to its prequels, there are no graphical improvements in the game. The ONLY cool and new stuff is Firefight, wich is like GOW's Horde mode.

By removing the ability to make a mass of units, having next to no base building ability, etc.; plus making so many things uninspiring and generic it took the fun away.
The enemy AI had a micromanaged feel to it (dong impossible things like the NOD stealth tanks doing a constant kite maneuver).

This review may be updated as time goes along based on the gameplay experience that Blizzard may change. As for now though, the launch and current gameplay isn't worth $59.99. In fact, I waited a few days just in-case something like this would happen and I was right. They did indeed have several issues.

I am very disappointed with this game. I feel that this is rather not a sequel at all to Diablo 2. Perhaps it would be an enhanced edition of the first series: Diablo 1, but not 2. Its gameplay mechanics and features are not worthy enough to be called a ""sequel"" to the game. I don't feel any resemblance to Diablo 2, but a closer resemblance of Diablo I in this game.

Only 4 players are only allowed onto a game. Compared to Diablo 2, 8 players were allowed. I really don't think this game is intended to be a Massive Online RPG if onlya maximum of 4 players are allowed into a game. This is ridiculous. I really do hope that they increase it to at least 6 players because 4 players just feels too few for a MMORPG.

For now, don't play Diablo 3. Not when the game is incomplete or half-baked. This game clearly needs re-adjustments before it can be taken seriously by players. I'd give this game another year to fix the major problems and then see the results.

The game tries to be a ""choose your own adventure"" samurai story set in the last days of the Tokugawa Shogunate era of Japan, but completely fails. Here's why:

-Even though there are multiple paths you can take through the game, you can beat the game in about 45 min. either way. Not even most 16-bit games are that short, and those are certainly a helluva lot more fun!

-The swordfighting is boring, due to the slow pace, lack of moves, and under-evolved fighting engine. And since that's the main gameplay hook, it leaves you with little reason to play. Dynasty Warriors and Devil May Cry both sweep the floor with this one.

-There's no voice acting. Just grunting and giggling sound effects. For a game that wants to have a story, this sure is a raw deal...

-The save system is just messed up. Period. There were occasions where I'd save my game, die, and find out that my file had  mysteriously been erased. And a quick look at some of the other reviews tell me I'm not alone on this one...

-The black guy with the afro. Seriously, what the hell is this guy doing here? Maybe if he actually said something funny once in a while, it'd be pretty neat, but as it is, he has no personality, and seems to just take up space. Leave him alone.

-The game world is tiny. It consists of 9 (I think) areas, that are each about the size of a football field. For a game that wants to have adventure game elements, this totally destroys everything, and is the final nail in this game's coffin.",ARGH!,1118188800,3,,

This game was awful and it had some of the worst controls and the most eye straining gameplay mechanics I've ever experienced. The entire game is played using only the Wii Mote. No joypad from the nunchuk, no plugging in a classic or GameCube controller, only the Wii mote and its awful dpad played sideways. The thing barely fits in my adult male sized hands.

There are times when you have to turn the Wii Mote around to aim it at the screen just to shoot at certain types of enemies that the game decided could only be shot by pointing the Wii Mote at the screen. And being that the Wii Mote barely aims properly, you can imagine how annoying this was. All of the other enemies in the game could be shot by simply pressing the shoot button while holding the Wii Mote sideways, no strategy, no skill needed, the game auto aims and shoots the enemies for you when you press the shoot button (one of the only 2 buttons used for gameplay, jump and shoot). This took away any chance the game could've possibly had at being fun.

The navigation through the buildings was so unbelievably confusing and you couldn't go back to certain areas after you've left them because the game wouldn't allow you to. Unlike in every other Metroid game where you could explore almost every area as often as you wanted.

Another annoying thing was having to fight side by side with some kind of galactic federation team. Instead of fighting as a solo bounty hunter like in every other Metroid game.

223400,1.0,False,"03 23, 2011",AFLRU6952DEFX,B004774IPU,S.,"This game has significant shortcomings which become more and more apparent with use.

Civ games have always been 'jack of all trades' empire management and war type games, but in this case, the sum of its parts reveals less than a full whole.  In short, if you are looking for a Civ game, Civ 3 or 4 would far exceed #5 in terms of 'the Civ experience.'  In terms of strategy games, there are obviously better ones out there, like the Galatic Civ Series, or Europa Universalis games, compared to 5. I'm not an expert on all games, but it seems like 5 needs at least one expansion before it can become worth playing and lives up to its name.

To start, the opponents' AI is lifeless and displays neither personality nor reason.  At least in Civ 4, religion united and divided AI Civs, and created the illusion that the AI knew what it was doing.  Here in Civ 5, the AI judges at best by relative military strength (every game does), and at worse, it just seems random.  City states are random as well - a vassal with random missions.

Granted, religion itself in Civ4 had very little depth, but at least it religion in Civ 4 provided reasons, admittedly simplistic ones, for the AI to form coalitions, rivals, and enemies.

The AI is inept in battle, and this stems largely from the 1-unit-per-tile rule, which requires a lot of thought to manage, and which the AI doesn't handle well at all or provide a challenge, since it fails to use tactics. It would be an improvement over say Civ 3's stacks of doom, which could not be decimated by artillery as easily as in Civ 4, but 1-unit-per-tile comes with many drawbacks in this game, which makes it a frustrating and annoying system here.  There are many ways to model combat strategically, for example involving supply limits per tile, but what is here doesn't work.

It isn't entirely surprising - the maps are rather small for this sort of combat tactics, and moving your own units is requires great attention and units easily bottleneck even in peacetime, causing all kinds of congestion.  The 1-UPT rule doesn't work for _this_  game, given that it forces you to more or less use combined arms (more than one unit) but units build incredibly slowly, as if they represent full armies (thousands or hundred of thousands of combatants) and not a simple cohort of say 750 archers.  It basically tries to do strategic and tactical combat, and fails at both.

Oddly, you don't need transports to move units across water - they just magically (!) morph into boats without having to build a navy !

Sadly, there isn't much to do in this game besides warfare, and the warfare and expansion isn't fun for a litany of reasons.  Wonders give boring effects in percentages and aren't really worth it.

The game starts with a limited number of civs, with several important ones missing (Spain being the biggest - what were they thinking?) and the makers want dollars for each extra one. I would hope a mod-maker will come along and just add a dozen custom civs themselves.  At this point, it isn't worth buying additional civs when the base game is largely inadequate.  Here's to hoping Civ5 can be fixed in an expansion - I doubt patches can solve the issues which have removed many layers of complexity but left the gameplay rather barren.

P.S. Yes, it has Steam DRM and requires an internet connection to activate.  If you can't activate it, you can't play it. At present it is 'rent-ware' subject to the quirks and survival of Steam, but it is possible that by the time this game becomes a bargain bin game, the makers may remove such limitations.

181506,1.0,False,"04 13, 2010",A2FTHCGH06O4Y5,B001NX6GBK,Caraculiambro,"Hated this game for many of the same reasons I hated God of War III.  Namely:

1.  The way this game was marketed promised a lot of hack-and-slash action.  Really, though, the lion's share of your time is spent doing timed puzzles, moving blocks around, pulling levers, turning cranks, etc.  Lord, if I haven't had an a**full of these!  Still, I must admit the gamemakers here were being faithful to the original text, since Dante actually says in his poem: ""ch'i' non averei creduto il numero di leve nell'inferno!""

2.  The actual adventures your guy goes through get mind-numbingly repetitive, even if you're playing through the game for just the first time.  Nearly every encounter is based on the ""cage match"" paradigm:  your character trips some sort of switch, whereupon some sort of of walls come up, and some sort of monsters continue spawning until you manage to trip another sort of switch, whereupon the walls come down and you are allowed to continue.  Yawn.

3.  There's no way to turn off the music!  I hate that!

4.  I'm proud of myself for having immediately and independently noticed what I later found everybody to be saying:  this game is a total ripoff of God of War (including the interlarded cartoony backstory)-- and not a very good one!

5.  This game has too many boss monsters and not enough pure adventuring.  It recycles monsters, too.  Admittedly, hopping on the back of that giant beast was pretty cool the the first time, after having to do it so many times it got old rather quickly.

6.  The game shamelessly recycles other elements too:  all doors open the same way, for example.  You stab some demon guy until he relents and the door opens.  Again, cool the first time.  Not the fiftieth.  Same thing for crawling across the walls filled with downcast souls.

7.  This game is too short for the price!

8.  Why were there so many gratuitous shots of people's private parts, starting with Beatrice all the way up to Satan?  The game couldn't have got by without this?  There's one scene where you're about to fight Lucifer himself, and as he's talking to you, his devilish dong is hanging out all over the place.  It's distracting.

9.  Your character's main weapon is preposterous.

10.  It's like the makers of this game were deliberately trying to anger people:  in addition to the completely unnecessary shots of people in the nude, did you know that Electronic Arts admitted to actually staging a fake protest in Los Angeles (putatively by an outraged religious group).  Look up the details on Wikipedia if you're curious.  How shameless.  Genuine religious groups ought to carefully consider this incident:  corporations not only love your outrage, these days they're actively trying to provoke it (as long as it's not Muslim outrage)!

11.  You cannot control the camera at all, as you can in many games of this type.  This is a shame, since there are some good visuals along the way.  This drawback gets pretty infuriating in some of the puzzles where you need to move the camera around a bit to get a good sense of what you're looking at.  Heck, even when it's not a question of a puzzle, the camera is awfully dumb about framing relevant elements.  As a result of this, the game has a very restricted, cramped feel, since what you see depends not on what your character wants to see but rather what the camera wants to do.

12.  The ""easy mode"" really isn't . . . the monsters are easier to kill, but the abovementioned timed puzzles still manage to infuriate everybody.

13.  This game is way too dark to see what you're doing.  If you turn up the gamma, it just bleaches out.

14.  The actual combat is exceedingly dull, although it may not look like it to somebody watching the game.  Although there are a plethora of combos available, nearly all monsters -- including all boss monsters -- can be safely dispatched by simply pressing the same button over and over again.

15.  The game forces you to go through a whole bunch of jumping and swinging challenges, but the graphics and shading aren't good enough to tell where your character is, so success in these is mainly just a matter of luck and memorization, not skill.

16.  There are extensive flashback scenes where Dante is fighting in the Crusades.  Don't you love how the cowardly dhimmis at Electronic Arts evidently instructed their graphic artists to obfuscate the fact that Dante & Co. were slaughtering Muslims during this time?

17.  Having to listen to the ponderous, sententious Virgil all the time gets old pretty fast, and you are forced to do it if you want certain relics.  Not only is his information useless for beating the game (he never tells you where hidden power-ups and stuff are), but it doesn't even help you understand the poem the game is supposedly based on (at one point, Virgil, speaking to Dante, speaks of ""our faith"").

18.  I hate the mandatory slow-motion during the combat scenes.  All fights regularly speed up and slow down without you having any say in the matter.  There should be a way to control this.  Curse your influence, Matrix trilogy!

19.  I hate watching the same cutscenes over and over again.  Why doesn't this game let you skip them?

There were, I must admit, a few things I liked about this game:

1.  There really are some stunning graphics in this game.  Those background artists are the real heroes of this production.  What amazing stuff.

2.  Danged if this doesn't get you jonesin' to read the real&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dante-s-Inferno/dp/0345522230/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dante's Inferno</a>.

For starters, we get this open, ""seamless neighborhood"".  No more loading screens!  Great!  and admittedly, the first couple hours of gameplay were really very neat. Your sims can walk, jog, ride a bike, taxi or drive a car just about anywhere in town.  What's not to like?
Well, there are no entry/exit animations for any of the vehicles, your sim just fades out of existence, then is magically in the car.  They even do this for the bicycle...also, while there are no loading screens, travel is pretty time consuming.  So, it is pretty much break even time-wise.  Once you actually get where you are going, there really isn't a whole lot to do. You could collect bugs or seeds, harvest plants, or fish...oh, and also collect gems.  Now, is this the Sims 3, or some bad MMO?

And most of the community lots are ""rabbit holes"" since, who wants to actually be able to go inside a restaurant or store to socialize, people don't actually do that!  We get a couple of beaches, too, but all you can do is fish in the ocean.  i guess swimming, tanning, building sandcastles, etc will be released in another overpriced expansion pack.

CAS is another bone of contention.  While all the customization with the LIMITED hair is nice, making a sim that doesn't look like a porcelin doll from hell is too time consuming to be worth it.

I'll take this opportunity to point out a positive:  The traits are a great addition to the game.  I love being able to combine all sorts of traits to get some really whacked out sims.  And once in a while, they will do something autonomously that is quite amusing.

Interactions with other sims are frustrating at best.  Gone are the days where if your relationship score is high enough with another sim, you will be able to perform more advanced social options on the menu.  Options pop into and drop off of the list at random.  Your sim may have a wish to marry the girl next door, but good luck trying to romance her that far.  Too much is left to chance for a control freak like me.

It just feels like EA gathered a group of game designers that had never played the sims together, explained the concept of the game, and let them have at it.  The results are really lackluster, at best.  We can't even create our own neighborhoods, like we could in the BASE sims 2 game.  Sure, someone said in an interview once that there would be a tool released that would allow to create our own neighborhoods, but I'll believe that when I see it.  As of right now, if you want a superior experience playing a Sims game, you might as well just stick with the Sims or the Sims 2.

223480,1.0,False,"09 21, 2010",AGO22C7H19EFR,B004774IPU,George R. Slater,"I feel that a lot of the reviews of this game so far have not been sufficient is explaining why there are so many one star reviews or why there is so much frustration. I will do my best here to explain why.

-Many have complained about bugs and crashes. These problems are very real and annoying.
-STEAM is annoying and violates consumers' fair use of a product

I will elaborate on the last Con in order to help some understand who may be ignorant to the issues at hand.

First there are a few misconceptions about STEAM.
-If you get a game on steam you can download it instantly. FALSE! I don't know about you, but my internet connection isn't instant. A person with an average 1.5mbs connection will take 7.4 hours to download 5 gigabytes best case. That's not instant. This is why I go to the store and buy the DVD.
-People don't like steam because they just want to pirate the game. FALSE! I have bought many games on steam and other places.
-People don't like steam because they want to cheat and not get caught. FALSE! I like punkbuster and hate cheaters.

I personally dislike steam for some very valid reasons. Because STEAM is required for this game to install and run it should be included in the review of the game. So, why is STEAM bad?

-STEAM support is virtually non-existent. (Just go to their web site and try to find the support phone number)
-STEAM requires you to update your game to play. To some this is not a big deal. Others may want to play a certain version that uses a specific set of mechanics or rules. Also, it is not unheard of that an update/patch has broken software. The consumer should have the right to play the version of the game they purchased at minimum.
-STEAM strips away your rights as a consumer to resell a product that you own (or do you?). After you link a game to your STEAM account you can no longer sell it or even give it away to another person unless you decided to give them your entire steam account. STEAM absolutely will refuse to transfer a title to another account or remove it from your account. NO EXCEPTIONS.
-STEAM requires an internet connection to play your game. So if you are on a laptop without access to the net... sorry no game for you.
-STEAM may shut down its servers at any time and leave you with an unplayable game until they come up again. If they chose to do so, they can shut down permanently and you will no longer be able to play again ever.
-STEAM may sell you a game that is completely non-functional (I had this happen). If you request a refund they will refuse. NO EXCEPTIONS. In my situation I had to wait several weeks for a patch to come out before I could play the game (which also demonstrates that it was not a fault of mine).

I do own many steam games. I will use it if I have to, but I hate it and think that REQUIRING it is the worst thing a game developer can do (STEAM is franchise suicide at best).

What many people do not understand is that there is a big push right now from many of the media corporations to essentially remove your rights as a consumer. The biggest push currently is that you do not own your software; under the guise that you are merely purchasing the right to play a game or use a software package.

Imagine the following situation. You walk down to the store and buy a paperback book. When you get home you set the book on the self and plan to read it next week. Later that week you sit down to read the book but are surprised to find that all the pages are blank. You go back to the bookseller to explain that the book you have is not readable and needs replacement or to be fixed. The bookseller tells you that you that ""the content for that book is no longer available and has been permanently disabled, sorry"".

Imagine another situation. You go to a bookstore and purchase a paperback book. When you get home you read the book and decide that you do not like it at all. You decide that you want to recover some of your costs and sell the used book to somebody else. The problem is that when you go to sell the book you find that the bookseller has permanently glued the book to your coffee table. When you contact the bookseller and ask why they did this and explain that it prevents you from selling the book to somebody else they explain that ""You merely just purchased the right to read the book and do not actually own any part of the physical book itself and cannot sell it to anybody, sorry"". So you get mad and tear up the book and use it as toilet paper... Then you get a call from the FBI explaining that because you didn't use the book as the original license intended that you are guilty of Copy Right Infringement and must pay a penalty of several hundred thousand dollars.

This IS the kind of crap that is happening and what STEAM represents and supports in my opinion. If you would be ok with this then by all means buy the game (it is fun). But I cannot support this and therefore urge people to not buy this game on principle.

Update:

There have been numerous comments that I have been unfair to steam. To which I responded with the following:

I agree with the first comment from Larry that it is true that steam does provide an offline mode and I neglected to mention that fact.

I think it is a very immature response to say that people who do not like what they see happening in the multimedia industry are ""crazy conspiracy theorists"". Whether or not you like the way software licensing is currently working, it is a FACT that the industry is operating in this way.

It appears many people do not understand copyright law very well. The original laws were created to protect BOTH the consumer and right holder. One purpose is to ensure that the creator of the work had an opportunity to profit from their effort (which is fair).

But for the consumer the first sale doctrine is specifically designed to protect them in cases like this.
<quote>The doctrine allows the purchaser to transfer (i.e., sell or give away) a particular lawfully made copy of the copyrighted work without permission once it has been obtained. This means that the copyright holder's rights to control the change of ownership of a particular copy ends once that copy is sold, as long as no additional copies are made. This doctrine is also referred to as the ""right of first sale,"" ""first sale rule,"" or ""exhaustion rule.""</quote>

So whether or not you want to sell your copy, I have the legal right to sell my copy of a work. A right which Steam withholds. And yes, back in the day, you could find many places/people that would buy your old games. You have honestly never gone to a video game store and seen a used Nintendo cartridge? It's no different.

Now, to address the statement ""I starkly anti-used game, because it hurts the game company (and said developers), no matter how good it may be for the end consumer."" [sic]

Your argument is akin to saying that when you are done driving your car, you shouldn't be allowed to resell it because it hurts the car manufacture. Ah, heck, why don't we all just burn our houses down once we are done with them, cause that would help with the housing market too... Greed is all that drives that kind of industry.

On another note; Yes I do agree that software piracy is a problem (I work in the industry). There are much better ways to go about handling pirates though. This approach only squashes consumers rights, and consumers have the right to be angry about it (Even if it doesn't bother you). Take for instance how apple handles media rights to music you purchase. You have to buy it and activate it for your machine. But, you can also deactivate it for that machine and transfer it to another. This same principle could be used as well for steam, they could allow you to remove a license from your account and transfer it to another. This would still ensure that there was only one copy of the game per purchase yet still allow you to retain your first sale rights. But they are way too greedy for that...

So what does this all have to do with Civ V? Simple, Civ V forces you to use steam... Hence it is a real part of the game. If you guys like steam, that's fine. Judging by the reviews of this game (and many others that use steam), it is a big enough deal that people don't want to play the game because of it and people coming here to find information about the game deserve to know.",Civ V and an explanation of STEAM,1285027200,83,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

*Battle system is a change - can be complex and challenging.

Cons:
*Story is the most unfriendly story I have ever come across in a FF game. After 30 hrs of playing, I still had no idea what my actual objective was supposed to be.
*Characters are all pretty unlikable with no real depth. Up to the point I got bored with this game (shortly into the second disc) none of the characters were really interesting.

And all that painful pop-up?  Come on it was 1998 after-all.  Well here we are, it's 2004, Driv3r has been loooong awaited by those of us who adored the first offering from Reflections and now that we have it, all I can say is... ""what the h#ll?!""  I'll only review this on the graphics merits, so if you like the game play and can numb yourself to the absolutely pathetic textures look away now.  Talk about pop-up, ""holy.. where did that car come from Batman"", the AI vehicles (not to mention buildings trees, power poles and peds) appear out of nowhere not more than a block away at times, they don't fade in, they just appear like some crazy magic trick.  Textures tear and flicker and quite frequently disappear all together just to reappear again.  Now mind you the lighting effects are beautiful (note Miami at dusk bathed in that golden tropical glow), but there is absolutely very little draw distance and the unbelievable amount of graphics glitches that are found at ever turn are utterly disappointing and inexcusable, they may have passed muster back in the day but not at a time when Project Gothem 2 and Grand Tourismo rule the roads.  I went back and ran PG2 and recounted Wreckless last night just to make sure I wasn't being too hard on poor old Driv3r but I came away being even harder on it.  Great video games start with (can you imagine) great graphics!  Call me a graphics geek but if a title can't draw me in visually then the journey for me and that title will be a short one.  How the creative teams at Reflections and finally Microsoft let this pass to distribution with so many bugs to work out is beyond me, Xbox has so much riding on the quality of the games to sell itself that allowing such a shoddy example of workmanship find a place on store shelves is inexcusable.  On the upside however Driv3rs' opening cut scene is the most cinematic I've ever seen, and frankly stunning!  The levels (cities) are huge and exacting in their detail but the clipping and over-all poor graphics execution relegates what could have easily been one heck of a game to the ""should-a, could-a, would-a"" file.

Removing the soft grip isn't that big a deal, but having to take off the safety strip and then force the remote into place is a pain.  And after doing all this you have to hold the 'barrel' in order to do much of anything with the remote itself.  The 'trigger' hits the ""B"" button just fine, but that isn't enough to navigate menues or pause for a moment.  And for shooting games where you have to change weapons or reload changing your grip all the time is a major distraction.  On top of which the accuracy is sub-par.

The more a terrible company like EA focuses on micro transactions and HUT cards for profit, the worse the actual game play becomes. I know there's plenty of obsessed kids out there with mom's credit card on file buying the latest stick and what not, and that is what drives modern video game profits. I'm OK with that, if the game itself stays intact, which in this case it has been stripped.

EASHL was core aspect of this game for years. Take out all the glitch goals, cheating and poor connection issues, the game was fun. Now they have stripped out any creativity and customization available. Your player now levels up instead of earning points to add to your build. Wait...build. That's gone too. No longer can you tweak your player to your liking or play style. You must enter a match up and pick from a previous built default player. What ever the rationale behind this was it failed. Weather to make things ""fair"" or they simply focused on their HUT money machine I'm not sure.

Once you play the game itself, the real disappointment sets in. Skating is slow and sloppy. You feel like gravity is multiplied and you are stuck in one place. Shooting is weak as well as the hits. Quick moves with the right stick are also no longer. I feel like the game went back to NHL 94 and stayed there with better graphics.

You will not be able to enjoy them because the game play of this title is completely busted. I don't understand the high praise at all and wonder if I accidentally got the wrong game included inside my case.

You are tasked with killing people, but you first have to search them out through the city. Easy right? Wrong. The cities are MASSIVE and you have to do various menial tasks in order to find clues that will lead you to the person. Ok, that acceptable too and had it stopped there, this might have been a different review.

But no, you are not allowed to step foot into the city because everyone knows who you are (I've heard of this thing called a disguise... but not Alistar or whatever your name is. Its set so far back in time maybe disguises weren't invented yet). So to blend in with the crowd you will have to play frogger and walk around endless swarms of people who just walk the streets all day and night. Collide with a single one and they will start shouting at you and the guards will run over and kill you. (Remember- if you bump into someone on a crowded subway you sure as hell better prepare to fight for your life against the police, you rapist.) Anyway, the only way to avoid people is to constantly walk around holding ""A"" which makes you put your head down (in shame as the developers of this ""game"" should) and walk at a snail's pace.

However you will still have to content with constant beggers who will walk in front of you (nobody else!) and harass the hell out of you and make you walk even SLOWER. But you can't even give them money to get them off your back! You just have to contend with them! Also for unknown reason there are also people balancing jars on their heads and trying to walk the crowded streets. If you touch them (and they seem to follow you to!) they will drop their jars and the guards will rush over and attack you.

That seems to be the conclusion for everything in this game, walk to fast - a guard will kill you, bump into someone - the guard will kill you, stable your horse outside the town but have the crappy AI make the horse STILL follow you and have it trample someones store while you are IN THE CITY - a guard will come and kill you. Climb up a wall- a guard will see you (or even be waiting on the roof!) and kill you. Stay out of the mob fest that is the town and just ride your horse through the plains trying to find anything good about this god forsaken game) - and a guard will be randomly posted in the middle of nowhere and kill you.

Overall, if it isn't obvious I HIGHLY recommend that you STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME. It is HORRIBLE and I have no idea how it is a Player Choice game. It is innovative yes, and the story seems to be really good (though I only was able to experience 2 chapters or so before rage quitting) but the gameplay is mediocre.

I think they are trying to fix things, but they have done so many things wrong so far that I just can't give this game a good rating. I have been plagued with problem after problem.

I have two copies of this game. My girlfriend and my best friend both bought me a copy without speaking with one another. It was very sweet. Well, I also have two computers that can play this game. One is a custom built computer and the other is a Mac. Well I convinced my girlfriend to play with me. The only problem is... well, we couldn't play the game together. Why, you might ask? Well, I could install it on my Mac just fine. There was no problem other than the considerable lag. I had to drop the video settings of course, but there was just constant lag.

No, I couldn't play with her because there was an installation problem on my PC. It took 3 days of troubleshooting to finally figure it out. You know, uninstall, reinstall, re-download the client. Run as admin. Run in XP mode. Nothing worked. No I had to manually kill the agent.exe process and manually start the process from within a folder before I could actually run Diablo 3 and install it. That made it work. None of the other stuff like updating my system, disabling my anti-virus, running in compatibility mode or anything made this game work. So, Blizzard, you failed big on this one. 3 days without being able to play.

What was my next problem? Oh, the constant lag is a constant problem. Updating things like my network adapter and reworking my wiring didn't fix anything. Checking my channels to find the best reception didn't help. It still lags.

The first few days the servers were constantly down. The auction house IS constantly down. The servers are still constantly down for some kind of maintenance. They threw this piece of crap out onto the market before ever really doing much. This doesn't feel like 12 years of planning and thinking for a new game. This feels like some piece of crap game they put together in about a year.

Then about a week in my buddy gets hacked and loses all of his stuff. Seems odd, but didn't surprise me too much as he isn't too big on passwords. I knew that. Oh, but a few days later my account gets hacked. Then I am in the forums noticing that there are a lot of people being hacked. Then another friend was hacked. Does this really sound that common to you? You think people who have been gaming for years get hacked this easily? No this was a Blizzard problem. Did they help me out? Sure.. in a way. Let me tell you how they helped me out. First, it took 24 hours to even respond. Then it took another 24 hours for them to let me know that I had to make sure I understood what a ""rollback"" was. How insulting to my intelligence. Then they finally rolled me back after another 24 hours. They didn't offer to give me any gold or help me out in any way. I was out millions of gold in items, 150,000 gold in definite gold lost from the roll back, a day lost on a character that I was working on, and the lame moderator just makes some snarky comments and says it's all taken care of now. Meanwhile the items I did have depreciated badly because the economy changed so quickly. I basically lost 3-4 days worth of game time and all kinds of other things because Blizzard is compromised. I made some suggestions for their security, but I am sure it fell on deaf ears. They just want everyone to use their authenticators because they assure everyone is 100% impossible to hack. Bullcrap. I'm not even saying it was impossible to hack me before, but it shouldn't have been easy.

The only light at the end of the tunnel is that I see some changes coming that might make the game worth swallowing in some ways. There are still tons of problems. They are firm on not letting people go ""free world"" in the game like Diablo 2. You have to select a quest and go from there. It's tedious. The farming is tedious. The game is tedious. There is no more rushing really. The leveling is boring.

I'll be honest. I would have been happy with Diablo 2 with a few changes in there. I wanted similar characters and play styles. They took powerful characters and a fun game and made it tedious.

They were even so arrogant as to point out that ""there is no cow level"" on loading screens. Oh, you mean one of the funnest things in Diablo 2 isn't in your game anymore and you think that is a good thing? Oh, let me shake your hand. Then there is this new unicorn level that they make ridiculously tedious (noticing a pattern here) to get into. I haven't even gone into it yet, because I don't feel like trying to farm the 5-6 different pieces required and the 100,000 gold item to make the level and not gain anything from it other than maybe a few giggles while slaughtering a unicorn.

The graphics and landscapes are pretty, probably one of the only good things. The enemies are unimaginative and all similar.

""Customization"" is all linear, not really many options here aside from randomly dropped items. If you get sick killing mobs of aliens over and over, this isn't for you.

STORY 0/10
Literally 2 minutes of meaningful cut scenes that explain nothing. You wake up from the dead, without explanation and fight 4 different kinds of aliens, that you fight for reasons nobody knows. Some of the story elements are apparently available to read on a website somewhere.
The only meaningful cutscene in the game is a setup for paid DLC

You can keep shooting mobs of aliens over and over, to earn better gear, so you can shoot more aliens harder better faster stronger, but why...

That SHOULD have given me a clue what was to come...

By day 7 I was able to log in and begin playing with two friends of mine.

It was like the money was appearing from thin air. This, in our minds, compromised a real ""city simulation."" Strike one...

Traffic, oh sweet mercy, the traffic. Even after multiple attempts at different road layouts and millions sunk into mass transit we could  not prevent traffic from becoming an issue in every one of our cities. A domino effect ensued. Because traffic was bad firetrucks could not reach burning buildings, school buses had trouble picking up kids, garbage trucks couldn't pick up garbage, and so on. Mid to late game all of our cities were in chaos. It felt like an exercise in futility to build a city at all. Strike two...

Somehow, I managed to keep a city alive and well when I played single player. I had maybe logged 10 - 12 hours in this city before I encountered an error so many others have: ""Unable to load the city at this time. Please try again later."" Strike three, I'm out...

38724,1.0,False,"11 6, 2002",A2WEVTFVH6D94T,B00006IZKO,Amazon Customer,"Wow, what a let down.  I was looking forward to this game for a couple of reasons.
1.  I love the books
2.  I love 3rd person action/adventure games
3.  Surreal had something to do with it, and I loved Drakan, the Ancients gate (which this engine obviously shares a lot in common with.....well, except for most of the good parts.)
Where to start on this turkey.....
A:  Graphics.  Very very similar looking to Drakan the Ancients Gate, but no where near the size/depth of the environments in that game.  The game looks passable, and that's the most favorable word I can use, but the maps/environments are very very small for the most part, and you are more or less on a very narrow *track*.  The graphics in general have a sort of cartoony, empty feel.  The game lacks much mood from a visual standpoint, and that's a shame given the source.
B:  Gameplay.  1 word...horrible.  All the problems that plague bad 3rd person adventure games are here.  Camera panning/orientation is one of the worst I've played in a long time, which again is a real shock, as Drakan the Ancients gate is one of the best in that regard I've ever played.  Weapon selection (not that there is much/any) is clumsy, and it's a real problem when using Gandalf especially, not that it matters much as the fighting is so simplistic.  In short, just about everything that can be annoying about control issues in games like this, is.  I really don't understand what happened, as the engine is obviously by and large the same one used in Drakan, and it's fantastic in that game.  Perhaps this game had a different team of people, or was actually in development before Drakan was.
Whatever the problem is, it sure is lousy.
On top of those two things, the gameplay being the major flaw, the game is shockingly short.  I finnished this game in 5 hours, with no cheats, no online help, no guides, it's laughably short/easy.  Also, the game just feels thrown together.  The cut scenes seem very rushed...it's hard to describe this unless you play it, but it really seems very thrown together.
In summary.  I wouldn't buy this game, and I have a hard time even recommending that you rent it.  I'm not sure it's even worth the 6 bucks or whatever your local rental place charges.
Avoid at all cost....what a shame, such potential to make a truly great game, and from (at least in part) a company that has made a fantastic game with more or less the same engine.  If your looking for a good 3rd person action/adventure that you may not have played, check out Drakan the Ancients Gate.

(then why is it required to have internet connection to play single player?  Read on:)

Day 1 RELEASE: (from the perspective of an 8 month pregnant lady on BED REST with plenty of time!)

Diablo 3, like it's predecessors, is a SINGLE PLAYER game with a small online player option. In previous Diablo games, you could play single player without an internet connection (which I would do a lot when my internet wasn't available) but apparently in a last minute decision, Blizzard decided Diablo 3 REQUIRES internet connection to play....P E R I O D!  My husband spent $60 per game for us to play this, and we can't even log into the game because their ""Battle Net"" servers have an unresolved issue.  WHAT!?  I don't want to play with anyone else!  I JUST WANT TO PLAY....by myself!  I think it is a boggle to the mind why Blizzard would demand us to go through a high traffic severely LAGGY server just to play a single player game.  Hello?!  What are they thinking?  If I wanted to lag to heck and back I would go play a REAL mmorpg.  What is up with these massive companies forcing us to use their servers (umm Skyrimm and Steam anyone??)  I am so disappointed because we have waited so long for this 3rd installment of a great franchise only to be told we must have an internet connection to play at all!  Believe me when I say that the single player mode is laggy as all get out.  I have talked to some people that can't even play the game.  They start to fight a monster only to die and not even know why.....the lag is that bad!
If you have not purchased this game, I would suggest holding off for now.  $60 for an unplayable game is a pure RIP OFF.  Wait until people are getting tired of it and maybe the online traffic will die down and in turn....the lag as well!  Wait until the price goes down to $25 (or less hopefully).  Pray to GOD they decide to allow us to play OFFLINE on single player mode.  Today is a sad day for the gaming world.  :(  I never thought I would end up rating this game a one star.....Sad but true.

UPDATE: Day 2. (almost 24 hours later) STILL not able to log into ""Battle NET Servers""  Reason given: There is an unknown issue that is not allowing the game to be properly authenticated, or I receive a ""server busy"" error.

It has been stated by a fellow player that the single player game (mind you it is different per person) was beaten in 12 1/2 HOURS!!! Even more shocking, this man was lucky enough to log in that long!

2 weeks after release UPDATE:

Ok I am really gonna RANT now!  I have been able to get online and play.  The game is decently fun, I'll at least give Blizzard that, but last night they patched the game.  I logged back in only to find my level 18 monk totally naked, no money, no stash box items and 3 people on ""recently played with"" list that I have never seen.  First of all I have not played with another person.  I have not added a friend in the game.  I am 8 months pregnant and I don't have time or patience to play with anyone else right now.  Upon further digging in the forums I found many other people screaming that the same thing had happened to them.  I sent an in-game report to Diablo 3 for in game help.  No reply as of 20 hours now.  I tried to call their 1 (800) number.....umm the hold time is a minimum of 2 hours!!!!!!!!!  I don't have TIME nor should I have to give that kind of time for help.  This is a GAME STOPPING ISSUE!  I cannot play the game because I have no armor or money to buy more armor.  I also read on the forums that no one has gotten help from Blizzard concerning this game stopping issue.  They are claiming we played with someone and gave them our password and they in turn....""Hacked"" our game.  Umm WHAT?  You are telling me that hundreds of people are paying $60.00 for our game....then randomly giving out our passwords to strangers that just so happen to be evil enough to take all we have?  Yeah Blizzard....it's OUR fault.  I'm just sayin if we would have been able to play the game without logging into battle net I wouldn't have been so called ""hacked"" as they say.  I don't believe I was hacked, I think it's a cop out on their part to throw the problem on the customer.  They have a game issue.

This is basically an 8MB memory card because in order to get the 16MB out of it, you have to compress and decompress every time you want to use it if you fill the card with memory.  And that's not the worst part.  EVERY time you put in a different disc, or hit reset, or turn the power from off to on, you have to insert the disc that comes with this card, let it load, pick your memory card, then eject, keeping the power on, and insert your game. If you don't do one of these steps, you have to start all over again because your game won't recognize that you have a memory card.  If you don't mind waiting 5 minutes every time you want to play a game, then this memory card works fine. But, come on, PS2 takes long enough to load a game already.  You don't need this.

I played the original gold box games when they were released, and this does not live up to the legacy. There are numerous crash bugs, a tendency for the save files to become corrupted and unusuable (wave goodbye to hours of play), a horrible user interface and the most unbelievably awful gameplay system I've ever had to slog through. I imagine that SSI, before starting development on PoR, had two folders available: one for the best features of the gold box games, one for the worst.
The devs picked up the wrong folder before starting.
The combat is terrible. It amounts to waiting (slowly, even with gamespeed set to max) for monsters to make their way towards your party and then, just as slowly, attacking them. And SSI brought in the 2-part turn method which was definitely NOT one of the endearing features of the gold box games. It makes for redundant effort and a great deal of wasted time. On the other hand, I *am* getting a good deal of reading done while waiting.
People have complained that comparing PoR to the Baldur's Gate/Icewind Dale/Planescape:Torment run is unfair. I agree. It's horrendously unfair to take a beta-code ""game"" which shows little to no knowledge of, to say nothing of love for, the D&D license and compare it to the magnificent efforts of Black Isle Studios' products.

I did manage to get the Directv guide to work, however, it is not the guide that you normally expect or use from Directv, but rather some kind of generic grid that Xbox apparently generates, which is far from easy to use.

The box advertises that you can set up this remote to be able to use it to control your home theater system, but all I could ever get it to do was to control the tv volume, which I never use.

Today I noticed that the neoprene rubber backing on both of the leg bands is tearing along the seam at the end of the velcro strap.  Each leg band has been used for approximately 24 workouts (equivalent to being worn for 12 hours). I contacted customer support and was told that EA's official policy was that the bands would only be replaced under warranty within 90 days of purchase, no matter how little they were used before the damage was discovered.  The customer support representative commented that this has been a very common failure and that the warranty department has been absolutely inflexible on the expiration of the warranty period.

The flaw in the design is obvious.  The line of stitches places holes (which concentrate stress) along the edge of where the inflexible velcro strap meets the flexible neoprene backing.  That promotes formation of rips starting at those holes.  EA should fix the design and replace all of the bands of the old design that fail.

The resistance band is very soft and does not provide nearly enough resistance for most adults.  I purchased a 3-pack of light/medium/heavy resistance bands from sporting goods store, and even the light band was significantly stiffer than the EA Sports band.

The graphics are of decent quality. That's really the only positive thing I can think of.

Now, the story, it's kind of dull. One real twist that I noticed and wasn't exactly expecting until it happened. It has a very linear story, which is mainly unbearable and it's made even worse with horrid voice acting.

The sound effects are so unrealistic. The M4 Carbine, which is your main assault rifle, has a very muffled firing sound. It sounds like a lot of peanuts being thrown against a wall and popping out of their shells. Grenades have a very generic explosive sound. The alien weapons (a massive TWO choices of alien weapons) sound a bit annoying the more they're used.

Oh, and that brings me to the amount of weapons you can use. It's a whopping six (6). Human weapons are as follows: M4 Carbine, MK23 Pistol, Javelin Rocket, XM8 Marksman Rifle. Alien Weapons are as follows: Energy Shotgun, Plasma Rifle.

The world is very linear as well. There's a certain extent of free roaming, but you'll end up going in a circle almost every time. At times, when free roaming, the game lacks a general direction of your next objective. It can be annoying at times. When you reach your objective though, the maps become even more linear.

cheapness factor-
 The computer LOVES to time its Lighting, Spike Shell or POW to make sure you fall off a ledge or make it possible for you to lose your first place slot.

 Whats up with the rare weapons like Lighting and Spike Shell coming up multiple times in a race? In former games those were few and far between. Three lightnings in one race? WTH nintendo?

 I don't want to lose a race when I have done nothing wrong. That just seems to happen a lot in this game though. Multiple spike shells FTL!

CONS:
-The passing is atrocious. It often goes completely in another direction.

-Your AI players are useless. Complete idiots who skate right into you.(Even in Superstar difficulty)  Defense-men let skaters just blow past them. Yep. Just keep skating backwards and do nothing to stop them. They will crash into your goalie and cost you goals and games.

 -Player switch is awful, and is completely random. I've given up easy crap goals due to this issue, as your AI defense men do absolutely nothing. AI players will completely let passes just go right by them, or head to the bench unexpectedly as you pass towards them.

-Puck pickups are god awful. You can flatten a guy and he still has enough time to get up and regain possession. This his also cost me plenty of breakaway opportunities and gotten me scored on.

-It's WAY too easy to lose the puck. Opposing skaters don't even need to poke check you. As long as they're anywhere near you, you lose the puck and they gain possession

-CPU is way overpowered. The momentum system in this game is insane. If they have the puck and you're down or up by a goal or two the AI has no problem roaring back. Expect to get scored on with half a second often from the strangest angles. Think the Karlsson goal on Henrik. -Scrub goalies like Greiss and Mrazek can absolutely rob you consistently while your goalie lets in everything and everything. This applies more to HUT. I find my goalie performs as he should in Franchise, but in HUT they are awful. Their rating doesn't matter. Especially after 20 games or so. They let everything in. Expect your stick to break or to whiff a shot when up by one or two late in the game. It never ceases to amaze me.

-Whiffed shots. So many whiffed shots. Why? Why is 97 Heatley, 94 Rob Blake, 99 McDavid etc whiffing on wide open one timers and slapshots so frequently?

-Slingshotting. Every now and then players will slingshot across the ice, as well as the puck. Why? How lazy are these guys?

- Menus. So many damn menus. Plus they're really slow.

- Music. Most of it is just god awful. And there's no option to turn off certain tracks. Again, why?

- Many star players aren't face scanned or haven't been updated in ages/have the same player photo since NHL 15.

-Crowd doesn't react appropriately most of the time, nor is attendance realistic. Why do the Panthers play to sold out crowds every time I face them?

-Commentary is awful and lazy. Players are often referred to as ""the shooter"" and teams as the ""away team"" and ""home team"". There are audio discrepancies in which certain pieces were recorded lower. Just very boring commentary. Doesn't feel like an NHL game, especially in the playoffs. There's just no excitement.

- Be a Pro is awful and boring. Nothing happens. You can score 50 goals in a season and get 2 contract offers for 1.5 million because you're an 81 overall. lol

-Celebrations are horrible. Just look at them. Stiff like robots. Player facial expressions are robotic. They showed more emotion in 15.

Pros
-Tie ups. Pretty neat addition and helps defend against one timers

-The crowd goes nuts with a late important goal, accompanied by camera shake. Neat!

-You can relocate in Franchise. Kinda cool if you want to bring back the Whalers.

That's about it for the Pro's. This game is god awful. Stay away unless you want to be filled with rage just about every time you play. Hopefully 18 is better.

Great memories of all of them - playing online and splitscreen at friends' houses. However, this is an insult to those memories. This is the most broken garbage excuse for a game I've ever seen. I don't know if most of the work on this got sidelined or fast-tracked or what, but it's just an incomplete mess and there's no excuse for that. I think the development team mostly focused on the remakes of the Halo 2 campaign and a few Multiplayer maps, but everything else is just thrown in there like so much trash.

The only good part of this collection are the reworked Halo 2 Campaign cinematics, but you can probably just watch those on YouTube. The redone sound effects for Halo 2 anniversary are super annoying - everything has this awful upper-end high treble kick and it just grates on your nerves so much after awhile that you don't even want to fire guns. The other campaigns are left alone, but you can't even play them in Co-Op because of the ridiculous lag - absolutely unplayable.

The multiplayer is an absolute mess as well - even with the newest patches. It's a miserable mess that's not even fun to play once you get into a game. And finally, the DESIGN of the menus and general UI is some of the ugliest modern video game design I've ever seen.

  Dear Jay

  My name is Cheramy, and I'm contacting you from the Microsoft Corporate office with the Customer Advocacy Team. I am calling in regards to your concerns about being charged for the Kinect, and the whereabouts of the shipment itself.

  I reviewed your case, and I see that you did the the replacement Kinect. Now, in order for us to be able to go any further, we are going to need the tracking number to the Kinect you sent back to us. If you could provide us with that information as soon as possible, then we can begin to resolve this once and for all. Only when we receive the shipment back from the courier, can we lift the hold on your card, so you will not get charged again.

  If you have any questions or I can help further, please reply to my email, and I'll be happy to assist you.

  Hope you have a good day.

Unbelievable Microsoft does it again!!!!!  Ok where do I start. I am so angry.  My kinect worked for 30 mins and then just stopped working. I have tried for hours resetting the box and nothing helped.  Microsoft sent me another kinect and that too worked for 2 hours then stopped working.  I literally have two kinect sensors and now they both are broke or shorted out.  The first xbox in 2001 was great,  I have had 5 broke Xbox 360s over the coarse of 8 years and now I get an xbox one that is basically broke right out of the package.  I will try to return this heap of junk for a refund and my relationship with Microsoft is done. I will never ever deal with this crap again.  Sorry guys I loved Microsoft for like 7 years but after the red ring of death I have had little patience and this I thought Microsoft would redeem themselves but it is up to their old tricks again.

Xbox fitness will not load with out kinect as some apps just can be played without kinect.

First of all, the battle system involves having to siphon off magic spells from the enemies and grafting them into your abilities.  This means that if you use them, your skills actually decrease.  Not only that, but because the maximum level your characters can reach is 100 instead of 99, you're actually susceptible to the nervewracking ""Level 5 Death"" spell.

Secondly, the cast is shallow and characterless.  The main character is grumpy and unsociable, and this reviewer could not relate to him as a player should be able to.  Also, none of the other cast are very memorable, like the characters of the other Final Fantasy games.

Lastly, the story is about as intriguing and deep as a pile of... well, you get the idea.  The story begins all right, but then lapses into a nauseating, mismatched soap opera between the main character and his rival's ex.  Not only that, but the main character's attitude prevents the gamer from learning what the ""villain"" is really after; they never give you a deep enough look at her.

 Some say the mixer box on the old GEN 2, 50s versus the newer one missing USB port  many find the USB port easier to use but the new one does have the mini jack to USb.

Many headsets are only virtual 7.1 or 5.1 many of them don't have the drivers built-in and therefore just do a virtual through the program of the computer and many of them you must already have a sound card in your PC to take advantage of the 7.1 ,  these headsets are only 5.1  and the mixing box that comes with this unit is basically its own soundcard quality wise is so so listening to a lot of reviews and other people you cannot replace the soundcard on the computers there's nothing compatible we made better currently.

We were considering these and one of the big points the Astro utilizes is the connecting one another to each other versus the chain which allows you to talk to one another through the headsets and the mixer and not through I don't mean  the computer so basically you can connect whatever bunch of friends only you guys can hear each other.

 For the money you can definitely get a better headset with true drivers and not virtual through the program or software.

 A lot of reviews talk about the quality and the changes and apparently over the years to change the headsets may take quite a bit of money one small piece could cost millions of dollars so the improvements may take or may just go to a new headset.

 We have not found an X ternal sound card versus the internal sound cards which are very good no one company yet as built an extern all say like the sound blaster where you could connected through the USB and then plug-in your stuff everything is still very separate.  So buying the equipment one has to pick and choose very carefully because the industry has a lot of stuff out there which is kind of all over the place.

 Another big problem is a lot of things are written for 5.1 and not 7.1 ( remember 7.1 has to be written into the programs that you can hear it this way if it's not it won't work ) 7.1 is fairly new and a lot of companies still say that the programmers haven't really program 7.1 only 5.1. There is still a lot of controversy and software update needed as we move into the future down the road 100% these issues will be solved but how long one does not know.

 Many people tend to like the wireless over the wired because there's so many wires want to comes  into the computer,  PlayStation and Xbox etc...

 The more buttons and batteries the heavier the headset is to,  add of multiple reviews many viewers tend to like the light headsets and the cotton material over the leather.  Sound quality is a big one and most of the top and headsets are pretty close to one another

2017 newest models Many people tend to like the 40s over the 50s they just feel well gaming they are just more convenient and features are readily available to them versus the wireless 50s for 2017.

TR should be full of secrets, full of amazing moves that you can do, and full of riddles and hidden paths. Reboot has none of that, it's just ""now press this button"". Plus there is nothing to explore, everything just falls in your path. Sure there are a very few optional tombs to explore, but those are mini puzzles and not really exciting. The main part of the game is killing enemies in a very brutal way :-(

Also there is NO swimming or diving in the whole game. Just run, shoot and a bit of jumping. A major disappointment!

There is NO variety at all. The same generic human character attacking you over and over again. No bears, no T-Rexes, no yetis,  nothing cool.
It takes place on one island and one location!!! No gorgeous realms and settings here. Sure the graphics are pretty but its honestly just the same setting and environment as you move throughout it.

The technique (an exact copy of the UNCHARTED engine) is breathtaking: Highly detailed graphics and subtle animations. However there is very little variety as most of the areas look like a giant scrapyard filled with bloody corpses and body parts!
Indeed, why does everything look so gloomy, dirty and run down? The previous games were characterized by stunning landscapes and mystical architectures. And here? Everything is broken, rusty, dark and NO mystical feeling! The feeling reminds me primarily of the newer RESIDENT EVIL games, both in graphics and gameplay.

The opponents act like zombies regarding the aggressive behavior. And it is very bloody and brutal. The programmers must have thought:  Give the primitive people what they want! What is really missing is SEX. Why is still no sex in it? Everyone wants Lara's breasts anyway, so give the stupid people what they want! Maybe the next TR will be a gore and porno feast... It wouldnt surprise me!

And why are Lara's eyes so small? Otherwise she is well done.

Pity about the otherwise great technology. No, sorry, but when I need blood and gore I play the RE games or one of the dozen shooters out there. If I want a great action adventure I play UNCHARTED. And if I want Tomb Raider, I would rather play the beautiful old games again.

These are the only truly wireless headsets for Xbox One and PS4 (different item, same model essentially). The sound is a million times better than the Xbox One Stereo headset. My buddies say I sound way more clear. Being able to remove the boom is a huge plus if you happen to decide to eat anything while gaming. Battery life is awesome. I don't know if it's lasting as long as they claim since I haven't timed it, but I usually go all afternoon until like 3 AM before the first low battery beep. This is with me using the headset for all audio output (they sound better than my TV speakers).

My biggest gripe though is this constant buzzing and occasional popping sound. There apparently is no grounding ability for this headset, so you constantly have to deal with electrical static sounds. I've noticed if I plug in a wall charger, the buzz goes away since it is now grounded to the plug. The range is also hit or miss. When I have the dongle plugged into the console, the range is mostly line of site. I had to use a 6 ft USB 3.0 extension cable and get the dongle to be more open to get the advertised range. It's very funny to see a dongle that says to keep away from other electronics to get the best range need to be plugged into an electronic that emits the very interference you're told to avoid.

PDP has outstanding customer service. I damaged and broke the original boom and without asking for reasons, they sent a replacement boom. Never seen customer service like that.

UPDATE: After 5 months, I can say that I have to deduct another star. The buzzing has become more pronounced. After receiving the replacement boom, it now has contact issues that cause it to have that huge static that you hear on TV channels without a signal. It even goes through to party chat. I feel like the quality just isn't holding up to time. There are still very few options for truly wireless Xbox One headsets. For everything it does, it is worth 4 stars. But, seeing how it goes downhill in less than a year, I can't say that it is worth more than 3 stars in time. I feel it will never go below 3 stars. I foresee these going from how it is now to flat out broken after more time passes. How long until then? Don't know. I just don't see quality dropping further. I feel they will break before they get worse. That to me is actually a good thing.

UPDATE 2: I was horribly wrong. 1 year and 10 months in and the quality has plummeted. The static sounds are worse. The ear cup material is pretty much garbage at this point. The range can barely hold out through 1 wall. The USB port is now loose, so charging is hit or miss. With more wireless option appearing, I say try something else first.

It would technically be supply-and-demand.  But it'd be illegal.  My last review of this product pointed this out and got cast into the flaming pit of fanboyism, as will assuredly happen again.  I know this, yet I'm saying it again - why?  Because I'm standing for something.  And that requires going against the popular opinion.  Sorry. But, well... not sorry.

Nintendo's not at fault for the scalping and I see that now.  But Amazon is condoning it, and shouldn't.  Luckily, 3rd party 'pro'-styled controllers are dropping on Amazon mid-December for a lot less ($35), which will hopefully bring some stabilization to the market.  And if nothing else, no one needs to buy from Planet Fun Toys or whatever they're called - the scalpers who are posting this product currently at an $18 markup.

I'm not against the product at this stage - I clearly don't own one yet if I'm whining about the price.  When I finally get one, I'll put up a review of the product itself.  Until then, if you like paying a $20 markup, ""unhelpful"" vote me into that pit.  All I did is I SAID SOMETHING.

So if you buy this game, be aware that you'll be limited to 3 or 5 activations and then you'll have to call Electronic Arts at your expense if you want to install it again. Your expense is currently about $[...]/minute in the US, check EA's support page for your rate if you don't line in the US. Say you sit on hold and get the call done in ten minutes. There goes another $[...] to play a game you supposedly already own!

What is an activation? Install the game, that's an activation. Change a piece of hardware, that uses an activation. Reinstall Windows without changing any hardware, that uses up an activation. You might even use up an activation upgrading a video or sound driver. Adding a USB peripheral device could use up an activation. You get 5 of these, then the game ceases to function and you'll get a message saying that you need to buy a new copy (not call them for more activations as it should say).

SecuROM has been known to give users errors or not allow an installation to occur due to CD/DVD drive incompatibility problems (usually older drives). You will typically get CRC or checksum errors while a file is being read from the drive. SecuROM also maintain a ""black list"" of processes where it won't allow the game to run if you have one of these black listed programs installed or running.

SecuROM is just plain bad news for the honest customer and to make matters worse it hasn't had much impact on piracy at all. In fact, the pirates enjoy greater freedom and far less headaches than the honest customer. Spore is a great example of why SecuROM is bad all the way around.

This game is truly awful. Not only is it boring, tedious and uninspired, but it ruins a really great series that I loved. The fighting system is the worst thing I have ever played. There are sporadic bad guys to fight, maybe one every five minutes, and EVERY ONE OF THEM IS EXACTLY THE SAME. They might look different, but they act the same, fight the same and never die (they just jump away and you see them 10 minutes later again). There are three fighting moves you can do. Yes, just three! And every fight is exactly the same. Hit him with the sword, dodge his attack, he gets all spooky magical, throw him in the air and slam him down, REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT. I wouldn't expect this bad of fighting engine from a PopCap web game from five years ago. What happened to the fun fighting hack-n-slash goodness from the first three games?

225552,1.0,False,"07 13, 2014",A1LWWV32S0CBNW,B004DTU0W2,Bobby Danger,"I'm on my third Razer Onza TE, but not because I love it so much I had to buy more. I bought my first one at launch.

The first one was defective out-of-the-box. Everything you could imagine wrong was wrong with it (trigger buttons did not work, the thumbsticks did not work, thumbstick tension adjust didn't work, and so on). It was unusable. At the time, even though the product was under warranty, Razer expected me to pay to ship the factory-defective controller to them. Fortunately, I was able to convince the retailer I purchased the controller from to replace my controller.

My second Razer Onza TE went haywire within a month. I would have thought that my local retailer got a bad batch, but defects seem to be common with the Razer Onza. The second Onza developed a similar set of problems within a month or so of regular use.

I am not the kind of person who smashes or throws my controllers. This time, Razer had me destroy the controller (seriously!), and take a picture of the dismantled controller and SN. I sent them that image and they sent me a replacement controller (my third and final Razer Onza TE). So, they have improved their customer service.

Now that I have that out of the way, here are my thoughts on my long-term experiences with the Razer Onza TE:

I like the way the controller feels in my hand, but the corners near the shoulder buttons are sharp and can be unpleasant to run my fingers along. The triggers, which are designed to more closely resemble the triggers on a firearm, look cool. They're not. After some time playing shooters or other games which demand frequent trigger presses, you'll realize these are horrible designed. First, they are absolutely uncomfortable for extended play. My fingers start to get a numb sensation--if you have ever played light-gun games in an arcade or gone shooting for a couple of hours, you'll know what I mean.

Perhaps more important, the triggers DO NOT REGISTER EVERY PULL. You read that correctly. You CANNOT USE SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPONS in shooters using this controller. Seriously. Whether you're using a rifle in Call of Duty or blasting zombies in Left 4 Dead, your trigger pulls will absolutely not match the game. If you are firing slowly and deliberately, this is not a problem. But if you need to fire quickly, the controller will fail you 100% of the time. All three of my controllers produced this effect: it is a design flaw, not a defect.

The thumbstick tension adjusts are awesome. I'm not sure why I would ever use the adjust on the left thumbstick, but I suppose it's useful for southpaw controller configurations. The tension adjustments feel like you could break the thumbstick if you adjust too tightly, and indeed, the user manual advises against tightening the thumbsticks too much--that is, there is no safety feature to prevent you from destroying your controller.

The face buttons are mechanical, and theoretically allow you to provide input more quickly than the 360 1st party controller's mesh buttons. Woo. The D-pad is entirely superior to the standard controller.

The remappable shoulder buttons are cool, and I didn't realize how convenient it is to have, for example, my reload button mapped to my shoulder. In effect, you do not need to take your thumbs off the thumbsticks, which can be a life-saver in twitchy games like COD.

The cord is lengthy (30') and is stiff. It includes a breakaway node, so if someone trips over your cord, they won't yank your 360 out of its home. It's USB, so it works on PC. In fact, it worked without any real adjustments--even the remappable shoulder buttons worked as expected. No install CD or wild goose chase across the internet to find drivers.

Now, to the wear-and-tear. Bear in mind that I work full-time, and I do not game as much as the 17-24 year-old demographic. I would say that I am a dedicated gamer, but not a hardcore gamer--I might go weeks at a time without using this controller. After a few years, the ""texturized"" coating on the thumbsticks have worn off. Now I have this uncomfortable, splotchy bit of rubber and adhesive for the contact area of each thumbstick. The right thumbstick has a defective neutral position. If I set the controller down, without touching, the screen/camera will pitch downward like I am moving the thumbstick down. Imagine trying to line up a long-range shot, and as soon as you have it lined up, the targeting reticle drifts downward. That sounds like fun, right?

I have been playing video games since Atari, and I have never had a 1st- or 3rd-party controller fail so relentlessly.

TL;DR: Your controller will probably be defective out of the box. Even if it's not, the controller has some serious design flaws which may outweigh its advantages.

Conjecture that it would be 2K12 with a roster update and only the absolutely necessary changes like the Astros to the AL and new schedule was in fact on the mark and as it turns out generous. It's a product that on its own is certainly not 2K9 levels of bad, it's okay for those who don't care all that much about baseball or haven't played recent iterations of the series, but represents a year that was not utilized to improve it yet the price remains the same.

2K Sports has essentially insulted consumers by failing to offer anything of worth with MLB 2K13 vs 2K12 and instead marketing the Perfect Game Contest as a distraction. In past years the contest has been propped up alongside the changes but nothing accompanies it this time around. There are no distinguishing differences in the gameplay or presentation and the primary modes appear to be exactly the same. Though it has been assumed to be the case the reason why the company failed to highlight improvements in 2K13 turned out to be due to the lack of any being present. Even worse, the feature set has been reduced, as Online League functionality has been removed. That's right, Online Leagues have been stripped out.

On the plus side of things cosmetic changes have been implemented. The Astros have their new uniforms and Safeco Field has its new outfield dimensions and video screen. The correct schedule appears to be in place within Association/MyPlayer modes. Outside of those type of elements though one would be hard pressed to point out anything different from 2K12. The menus and interfaces are the same, no work has been done to the dated graphics including the jagged shadows and ugly player faces, and the player pictures are outdated - even for someone like Ichrio who has been with his new team since last season. Poor Yoenis Cespedes is still stuck with his cyberface from last year. The pitcher-hitter battle remains strong but only because that was already a positive in 2K12.

There are the off-putting animation speed inconsistencies often seen in pitching and catcher throwing motions and then oddities like (see Pastapadre Youtube page for videos). Of course none of it is surprising as the same problems were seen in 2K12. The throw meter takes some getting used to again as the ""green"" area to hit can be tough to judge in a split-second and missing (even going soft thinking it's safe) usually results in an error.

In a full season sim within Association mode the Reds came out with the most wins (99), Jose Bautista led the league in home runs (54) followed closely by Curtis Granderson (53), Bautista won AL MVP, Aaron Hill won NL MVP, and the respective Cy Young winners were Vance Worley and Dan Haren. The AL West had all teams but the Astros over .500 and even they won 79 games. The Playoffs in the AL were comprised of the Mariners and Angels (play-in) along with the Rangers, Twins, and Rays. In the NL it was the Brewers and Diamondbacks (play-in) plus the Reds, Rockies, and Braves. The Braves would go on to win the World Series in six games over the Rays.

Commentary, what has been the strength of the series, is largely recycled. There are a few throwaway lines in about a team's performance last season or for the players who had high profile 2012 campaigns like Mike Trout or Bryce Harper, but otherwise there isn't much new. Even the Astros' move to the AL wasn't touched upon at all in the multiple contests I had them involved in with the hopes of hearing something about it.

There is also no reason to expect post-release support of any significance. If there is a patch it will have to wait until after the Perfect Game Contest period as was the case last year. MLB Today Season mode never even worked properly in 2K12 - no reason to think it will here. Support was dropped around midseason for MLB Today period. Occasional roster updates could be all that's ultimately delivered post-release.

The MLB 2K series still presents decent fun factor but the swindle 2K is trying to pull by putting practically the same game on the market for a second straight year minus an important feature can't be overlooked...particularly when factoring in the $60 sticker price. Criticize any other league licensed product on the major consoles all you want but no other has ever attempted to release with zero gameplay enhancements or changes to primary modes and nothing additional for the feature set. If MLB and 2K had any thoughts of sticking together into the next generation of consoles this game should completely bury that possibility. The league should be embarrassed and 2K has shown no pride in the franchise and no ambition to continue it.",MLB 2K13 isn't just 2K12 with a roster update...it's less than that,1362441600,250,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

So hooray, Amazon finally has the product. As with all Razer products, very nicely boxed...too bad my N key was dead out of the box. I never got a chance to try the keyboard seriously first time around. Also I was immediately not impressed with the backlighting, it seems too dim on all the keys, but the Razer logo glows annoyingly bright on the bottom edge. If the keys could be half as bright it would be good.  Also the font they chose for the letters on the keyboard is too modern and simply hard to recognize. I have been using a Logitech Mac edition of the diNovo, and its feel is far superior feel to the Anansi. I am getting a replacement, and I will give it a good test.
 And fortunately, as always Amazon makes returning a breeze.

OK UPDATE...Feb. 2012
Gave it a good test. Kept at it, hoping it was a learning curve thing... nope. Unfortunately, little good to say. Now I really wanted to like this because I love the Naga mouse.

Now to be fair I have big hands and the Anansi was not easy to type on as a normal keyboard. Even though the unit is physically large, the keytops themselves are too small with larger than normal beveling. Feel for me could only be described as really lousy, for touch typing I kept hitting 2 keys at once.

The keyboard uses 2 USB ports because of the power needed for backlighting, and that is annoying when you have a lot of peripherals. I prefer using a separate power AC source, like Logitech gaming boards. The whole keyboard is very light, and does not have ""sticky"" large rubber feet big enough to prevent it from moving on my desk, especially when the rear feet are flipped up to provide a positive angle of attack. One of the 2 main reasons I wanted this keyboard was the set of dedicated modified keys on the bottom edge, giving a supposedly easier way of hitting modifiers with the Naga. The idea behind the design is to be able to hit these with your thumb while left hand fingers are on the WASD keys. I found that very difficult, if not impossible being the modifiers are close together and I was always hitting the top row key when reaching for the bottom row. These keys for some inexplicable reason are rubber-covered, so the side of your thumb will not slide but tend to catch even a small corner of the unintended modifier key.

Obviously, since this is a human interface device, my comments are from my point of view with my hands and personal dexterity. I would same someone with smaller hands would do better, but them there is the issue of the thumb reach to the modifiers, and a small hand would have to move off the WASD keys to get the further keys. Remember, this is gaming, so the right hand is going to be on the mouse. Meaning you have to be able to reach all the modifiers keys with your left thumb or it defeats the purpose.

On a positive note, it is attractive on the desk, and Razer does a ridiculously great job of embracing the customer with their packaging on all their products....unfortunately in the case of the Anansi I would encourage them to go back to the drawing board and deliver a keyboard worthy of accompanying the great Naga, because for me this just ain't it.",Not worthy to accompany the superb Naga,1319587200,8,{'Platform:': ' MAC'},

For starters, he's cross-eyed with a small head, arms as thick as his legs and his face reminds me more of a reptile than a male protagonist.  They tried to copy the Nathan Drake character from the hugely popular Uncharted series and failed. Instead you end up with a freakish appearing persona which I did not like in the least.

i shredded modern warfare 1 after i had finish playing the s.p and found out how the multiplayer allowed the heli to target the better players. that's not how you make a good/great game. world at war was better imo and many many people loved it. why didn't u just continue on that path and allow gamers to relish in your work. no u must follow the blind (other game creators) and as with some of them, will fall in the foolish ditch. how idiotic can u really get?
now i got his game thinking that activision would improve upon what was bad with the last m.w. 1 game and all they did was make the thing worst. activision is behaving like e.a, thq and others with these garbage softwares that you must install to play the actual that u spend your money to buy.
 as i am typing this review i am installing the game after the long process of installing and creating a steam account. it's after that that i can install the game which takes 16 minutes. and believe me my computer is nothing to laugh at: i have a p5q3 m.b, q9550 cpu overclocked to 3.9 ghz on liquid cooling completely stable with ddr3 memory runny at a little over 1800 mhz, a gtx oc 275 o.c amongst the other high end products my system has, so believe when i say my system isn't slow or near slow by any means. man i am so mad at at activision right now. $60 dollars for this garbage.
you (activision) will want most of these 300+ reviewers to buy your games in the future. i hope that like me, since they are equally upset, if not more, will not buy another game from you until you leave people to have the right to use their purchase as they see fit.
this is my first 2009 game purchase for i made up my mind not to buy any games from thq or e.a amongst the others that's putting all kinds of game restrictions on peoples purchase. i thought u at activision would use wisdom and see how many persons have walked away from purchasing e.a and others games because of what they are doing to their games. And u go ahead and follow those clowns. i will not buy any more of your games if this is how you intend to operate.
i hope the market rejects what the gameing industry is doing and then when you can't make a profit and is going bankrupt then you will go back to your roots and make games the way people want and not what you want to impose on them.",what a piece of c***,1258329600,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

i can't even imagine paying a subscription for this garbage I've played smoother HTTP games - where the creators actually seemed to care about what their presenting and their gameplay content.

its pretty clear from the 1st few days you spend playing this garbage if you can stomach it that long, that the designers clearly are just milking a brand name with absolutely zero care factor to actually the game itself, the combat, and even movement of your character in general is SO BAD it reminds me of pre-diablo 2 clumsiness its like the creators have never played a single MMO but just kinda had an ""idea"" what an MMO is and tried to abstractly create it - which i could accept IF they actually stuck with what a Final Fantasy should be, a THRILL RIDE of AWESOME that leaves me wanting to continue to play it each step along the way with over-the-top epicness, like FF7, followed through with attention to detail and stunning cinemas - this game is NONE of that

after a little research you'll find out just how lazy the creators of this game are and who they have overseeing things, for example 3 YEARS ago apparently they messed up the ability to buy single quantity out of stacks placed on the market place - so literally if you want 1 of something you can't buy it, you'd be FORCED to buy the entire 99 stack for an obscene amount which leads to a lot of market-place scamming and just general badness and its remained that way for 3 years - 3 YEARS - and hasn't been corrected so no i doubt any fundamentals in this game are scheduled to improve - ever - they patch stuff - mess stuff up, and thats it - its DEAD JIM. - their so clearly just milking the brand name its disgusting.

for example the cinemas are extremely poorly done, words fail to describe it, maybe a 5 year old could like them, but definitely not 8-10+ their not even voiced, and the text is so corny and BAD its not thrilling or exciting in the least, the best cinema so far is the trailer, go figure. *makes a fishing reel sound*

They ""tried"" to do a Gold Saucer, i guess... the few games they do have are so lame, sadly as previously stated just a huge disappointment  FF7's Gold Saucer for example puts FF14's Saucer to shame.  They even managed to ruin Chocobo Raceing to the point that its a dead aspect in the game.  It defies logic how FINAL FANTASY could be so LAZY and PATHETIC that their predecessor game from 7 ENTIRE generations back, is better designed and more fun then their current Saucer and i think that speaks for itself with how the entire game is created and maintained.

Character Creation, is also a joke in this game - you get like so few choices on what you look like overall you end up looking like everyone else, there is ZERO ability to manually tweak your physical characteristics for example you get a set slide of choice 1-6 and thats it, so expect alot of other people to look EXACTLY or nearly exactly just like you.

I Wish i could of wrote a better review on this game i love most of the Final Fantasy games, sadly this garbage will never come close to being a real Final Fantasy.  its just a badly designed MMO ""wannabe"" with a brand name it'll never deserve.

If you want a REAL MMO i'd suggest Guildwars 2 - smooth/fluid combat, a marketplace thats actually well designed. Oh and yeah, you can actually tweak every detail about your face - nearly - its not as extensive as skyrims character creation, but you can fiddle with enough of the parts manually adjusting enough aspects that your face won't likely be someone else face.",this falls well below standards for the brand name - its so clunky and BAD - i can't even imagine paying a subscription for ...,1484611200,,"{'Edition:': ' FINAL FANTASY XIV Online', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

184289,1.0,True,"10 22, 2011",A2FTHCGH06O4Y5,B001SGZL2W,Caraculiambro,"I was looking forward to this game but found myself only lukewarm to it after the first few days of play.  After that, though, indifference gave way to fury.

These are not in any particular order -- except the first, which brought my game to a halt:

1.  First of all, I hope you think gambling in a video game is fun.  I don't.  I played this game for about five days until I got to this point where you have to play something called ""Liar's Dice"" to continue.  Quite apart from the fact that I find gambling idiotic and gambling in a video game silly in particular, I couldn't figure out this mini-game and couldn't win at all, which one has to do to advance the plot.  Hence I could not advance the plot and the game came to an end.  There was no way to continue.  I tried everything.  I tried shooting the guy who deals the dice.  No luck:  he simply respawns.  I tried buying the classy suit that allows you to cheat.  Doesn't help.  There was simply no way to move this game forward and therefore we were unable to finish it.  I found it absolutely beyond belief that Rockstar Games, a multimillion-dollar publisher of mainstream video games, would have authorized the idiotic decision to have one of their showcase titles completely held up while the player learns and wins this absurd mini-game.  After three straight days of playing the idiotic ""Liar's Dice,"" we (neither I nor any member of my family) was able to win a single round.  Thus we couldn't continue with the game and finish all the missions.  After that, the game went back in the closet.  Uh . . . who is making these decisions at Rockstar games?

2.  I've hated video games before, but at least I understood what was going on.  This, though, would have to be the first video game that I spent confused the entire time.  You're riding along, minding your own business, and suddenly a blue dot appears on your mini-map and somebody asks for help:  ""They stole my horse,"" etc.  The problem is, no sooner do you dismount than suddenly 5 red dots appear around you and shoot you to death.  Wait, what?  What happened?  Who's shooting me?  Why wasn't I given a second to ready myself?  Alternatively, 6 red dots appear out of nowhere and begin shooting at you for no discernible reason.  These sorts of challenges (I think the game calls them ""unattached criminals"") were extremely poorly done.  There's another one that is fairly typical of the way the game works:  you're walking through town.  Somebody approaches and says, ""Hey, my horse was stolen!""  You whistle for your horse, mount it, ride towards the indicated dot for about a second before it says, ""You let the thief get away,"" or ""You failed to catch the thief.""  Although you weren't really allowed to chase him down to begin with.  With most of these challenges, there's simply no way to win.  Additionally, it's not clear why challenges reappear.  Did you not do it right the first time?  For example, I can't count how many times I had to clear the bandits out of ""Pike's Basin.""  Was I failing it in some way?  It said ""complete"" (or at least I thought so), but as soon as I cut through the basin again, lo! the bandits had all repopulated and the farmer needed help again.  This was puzzling:  is this simply an eternal challenge that you can always do when you need cash or was I leaving something undone?

3.  The visual style of this game recalls the Sergio Leone films, and I was hoping it would be a gritty exploration of the seamier side of the Western myth.  But a lot of this game has you shooting rabbits and picking flowers!  This is absurd!  I'm playing this game to play a tough cowboy who gets to shoot bandits and so forth.  If I wanted to roam through the desert looking for flowers, I wouldn't need a video game for that!  In addition, picking flowers is a sissy activity that my manly cowboy wouldn't be seen doing!  Also, skinning armadillos and horses?  Am I the only one who finds this degrading?  If the game was going for realism, then why did it give me a magical map?  And a magical horse?

4.  Traveling to distant places was a frustrating hassle.  Sure, there's a fast-travel system, but why was it so complicated?  Why do I have to leave town to fast-travel?  I can understand not being able to fast-travel in the middle of a mission, but why can't I fast travel from my hotel room, or anywhere else for that matter?  Sheesh!  I got the feeling that, in the early drafts of the video game, you WERE able to fast-travel anywhere from anywhere, as is logical, but at some point some supervisor pointed out that if players were able to do this, they'd finish the game too quickly.  Hence the fast-travel system was deliberately made more complicated so as to drag out the game.  ""You need a better spot for your campsite.""  Why?  All the bandits are dead, plus this town loves me!  Why can't I save here and now?  Who cares if it's close to the water?  And why do I have to be subjected to that intolerable animation of me kicking out the campfire?!  I've seen it a zillion times!  Skip it!  It's not even the loading screen!  It's just some stupid animation that you have no choice but to put up with.

5.  There are no difficulty levels in this game, at least in the PS3 version.  Some of the missions are really hard (or confusing) and you're not in the mood.  Tough luck! Everything must be completed on full difficulty.  Someone told me this game was constructed so that if you fail a mission, it gets easier and easier until you pass it.  I don't know how that rumor got started, but I can confirm it's not true.

6.  You cannot skip missions if you find them distasteful.  WARNING:  Do not play this in front of your family.

7.  On the other hand, there's no way to replay missions if you liked them -- without replaying the entire game.

8.  There is a problem with my cowboy's vision.  The enemies can see him from a million miles away, but there's no way for you to see them.  If they're hidden against, say, dark bushes, there's no way to zoom in and really see what it is you're looking at until you see the puff of smoke that indicates they've shot at you.  Meanwhile, they have no problems seeing you clearly from long distances with complete accuracy.

9.  Your enemies have line of sight to you when you're behind cover and their bullets can often hit you through what are supposed to be solid obstructions, such as adobe walls.  Meanwhile, your bullets cannot pierce solid obstructions and hit them while they're taking cover.

10.  This is one of those cursed video games that thinks it's cool not to give you a health meters but instead start to splatter the screen with blood when you start to get damaged.  Why are video game manufacturers doing this these days?  It's such an inferior system.  The upshot is that you don't know how much health you have!

11.  The story setup is fairly good:  the federal government has strong-armed you into bringing back a famous bandit.  Fine.  But then several missions have me getting involved with characters that would be out-of-character for me to get involved with, much less help.  Seth, the guy who digs up coffins?  I wouldn't have gotten involved with him.  The doctor that sold elixirs?  I wouldn't have gotten involved with him.  The gamemakers made much of the fact that they are supposedly giving you a full world to explore, but the reality is that they railroad your characters majors decisions at nearly every point, and in a way that palpably went against the grain of my character's motivations.  Why would I be getting involved with a nickelodeon producer?

12.  The non-nature graphics of this game are not good.  In particular, I'm thinking of the animation of people's faces.  Really, this is the best gaming technology can do by this point?  I might have been impressed in the late 90's, but by this point . . .

13.  There's no way to skip many of the cutscenes!  Interminably idiotic dialogue!

14.  If you die unexpectedly (e.g., a fall, a wild animal, an unexpected encounter), you are not resurrected anywhere near the action, but at the point of your last save!  Why!?  Why do I have to ride clear across country again?  Are the game makers trying to punish me for something?  This wasn't fun.  Game is supposed to be fun, not infuriating.

15.  You can't swim!  I found this ridiculous.  I thought my cowboy was supposed to be a hero!  Are you telling me I can be killed by a 2-foot-deep puddle?

16.  Game is not clear when it's saving or which values it is saving.  If you loot bodies, the money you net is not saved if you then die.  But if you meet someone, that is saved.  Clarity and consistency on this would have helped.

17.  You can't zoom in on anything to get a good look at it.

18.  Load times are pure murder.

19.  Why does the game orient you in the completely opposite direction after you've looted a body?  Are you trying to get me killed?  This can be very disorienting in the middle of a fight.

20.  Speaking of which, am I supposed to loot bodies or not?  It seems vaguely dishonorable, but the real problem is that if you don't, the bodies sometimes magically disappear after the combat is finished.  Hence am I to assume you're supposed to loot them DURING combat?  If so, then why do the NPC's either run along or claim you've abandoned them when you take a minute to loot your fallen enemies?  All the while I played the game I couldn't tell if I was supposed to be looting bodies or not.

21.  One needs to access the map so frequently that it should have been only one click away, not two.

22.  Game is very confusing about why some items in the general store, the gunsmith, etc. are not available.  Is it because the attendant missions are not yet unlocked?  Because of my low heroic ranking?  Because they don't sell that in this part of New Austin?  Because the shopkeeper is temporarily out of stock.  This kept me confused the entire time I was playing the game.

23.  Your hero can't climb most things.  I found this preposterous.  It really takes you out of the game, as this is not you fighting the hard world of the Wild West but you butting heads against the clunky command interface of the game.  I can't climb on top of a wooden crate, yet I'm a legend in the land?!

24.  The prices for ammo were preposterous:  twenty-five samoleons for 5 repeater bullets?!  And this is at ""hero"" prices!

25.  There sure were a lot of uninvited adventures dumped on your character.  I don't think games should get you in an adventure whose failure entails a penalty -- without first seeking your consent.  For example, suddenly you've got to drop everything you're doing and rescue the sheriff held captive somewhere in Tumbleweed.  If you don't, the adventure will disappear and you'll lose the benefit of completing it.  Shouldn't I get to at least consent to this by stepping on a golden X or something?

26.  I must have the stupidest horse in the cosmos.  When I whistle, he comes running, but nowhere near me.  Is he playing mind games with me?  Then, when I start shooting, the horse actually steps between me and the targets!  Does he desire his own destruction?  There should have been some way of shooing the horse off.

27.  You can't load your weapon at will.  Basically only in the middle of a fight.

28.  The auto aim system really blows.  You end up doing most of the work anyhow.

29.  The game bizarrely equips you with your hunting dagger just after releasing you from a cutscene right before facing a dozen distant enemies.  It sure wasn't me who equipped my hunting dagger!

30.  In the very last mission of the main storyline, the game deals with the player in bad faith, implying that something in possible when it's scripted and unavoidable.

31.  Taming a wild horse was so poorly programmed.  It took me nearly till the end of the game to realize that you're not supposed to be L'ing and R'ing based on which direction Marston is leaning -- as one would think -- but rather based on which way the head's horse is facing.  Am I the only one this stupid?

32.  They should have included an RPG launcher as one of your weapons. In the spirit of the Old West.",I ended up hating it,1319241600,8,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

My favorite features of these games have been the resource management, the planning and building of cities, the planning and colonization of islands, the exploring, the natural disasters, the customization of map and game settings and the replayability (like I said, I've been playing Anno 1404 fo years and years now). The attention to detail in the creation of these games is amazing, and is really what makes these games so immersive. The options are massive! I've put in hours upon hours on Anno games. My steam account for Anno 2070 has something rediculous, like three hundred hours played, and that is on the repurchased game I purchsaed through steam to get updates more efficiently. I'd played for many hours before that on the PC version.

So, when I say I've been looking forward to this new Anno relaese for so long, you understand what I mean. I have literally been checking every few weeks or months for news. Then, an anno app came out on iPad, and I bought it immediately. Then, I disliked it immediately. It was a shallow, boring shell of the PC version, and I had a sinking feeling. Other Game franchises I like have gone to the mobile platform and their PC versions have suffered greatly. The PC versions basically become a slightly more complex (or not) version of the mobile game, as if the mobile game was created first and modified without any enthusiasm or much thought for PC gamers. I held out hope that wasn't what was happening to my beloved Anno. Then, Anno 2205 came out on PC, and the reviews were not good. The reviews indicated what I had feared, that this game was a shell of its former Anno self, geared towards mobile devices and not PC. So, I waited. I didn't want to pay full price (something I'd done with out question on previous Anno releases) and when it came down to a price I was willing to risk, I bought. I paid $35, and still, that was too much. I cannot fully express my disappointment. I've played a few hours now, over a few days, and here are my thoughts.

Anno is gone. It is gone. What I played, this Anno 2205, has very little in common with the Anno games I love. There is no resource management. There is no planning for building supply chains or cities, you just need a road. There is no need to think of warehouses and roads, getting supplies to stores quickly without building too much and costing yourself too much money. There is no more big world map that I can peruse and watch whales swim, track the progress of tornados, see where my ships are, or peak at my neighbor's cities. There are now loading screens between my islands, and I have to wait for what seems like forever, whereas before I could just scroll around. In Anno 2070, I could scroll my mouse wheel and suddenly be under water! I was hoping Anno 2205 with it's moon base might be something similar, or at least more streamlined so I don't have to sit there and wait. Battles happen in a separate loaded screen with a small fleet of upgradable ships, no more shipyards or island protections. No more randomly running into pirates or avoiding pirates like before. No more seeing opponents go at it with each other or pirates in the open ocean. There is no randomization or maps or islands (ok, I realize the maps and islands in previous anno games weren't truly random as the islands had a few basic shapes, but still . . .) where I could set up game with such a varied win senerios or turn on/off players and disasters. The replayability was endless. There is little of that with Anno 2205.

Reviewers have said the graphics are incredible. I wouldn't know. The game runs so slow and jerky. It crashes sometimes, and at first I thought it was my system was not good enough, but I am within the recommended settings, so I shouldn't have such poorperformance. Even on lower graphics settings, it's slow and jerky. Load screens are too often and too slow and game play, what boring point and click there is of game play, is interupted constantly. This game does not flow at all.

Anno 2205 is boring. If you've played and loved previous anno games with all their micromanagement and planning, you'll probably find this new Anno release seriously lacking. I recommend waiting until it is deeply discounted before you buy or try a demo somewhere first. At this point, I am seriously questioning the developers choices. They've taken everything out of Anno that made it Anno. Why? To make it more compatible with mindless mobile apps? Well, they've lost this fan on this one, and I'm not the only one . . .",Not the Anno I have come to expect and love,1467072000,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

Out of the box they look great. They feel good, they're comfortable and I had high hopes. However, the setup process was not particularly straightforward. There are some audio setting you need to mess with on your xbox and even then the mic would some times just not work. Pairing the headset to the dock is simple enough, but I found that sometimes I'd power them on and my mic just wouldn't register at all in party chat. Only a full power cycle of the xbox and headset would resolve the issue.

Then comes the real problem. The random disconnects of the headset are absolutely unacceptable in a headset at this price range. My headset will constantly lose connection and I can see it disconnecting on the dock as well (when the headset is on the dock has battery info displayed on the front). This happens seemingly at random and nothing I have done has seemed to fix it. I tried repairing it to the dock. I updated the firmware to the latest version. I made sure that the headset had plenty of juice. My router is nowhere near the dock or where I'm sitting and I live in a pretty big house so I'm not anywhere near the kitchen either. I tried multiple optical audio cables (including the one I used with my previous astro headset) and nothing helped.

I also tried contacting astro, but that proved to not be very helpful. I wrote a rather detailed email about the various steps I was taking. I watched their YouTube videos on how to set it up and double checked all the wiring. I even called astro but apparently you can't speak to the tech support guys on the phone. The guy I did speak with was nice and tried running through a couple troubleshooting steps with me. He said it would help speed things along and that he would add some notes to my account so we can skip to some more advanced trouble shooting methods. However, when I received my email from the tech support guys, all they did was ask me to do the exact same stuff I already told them I did (via the email and on the phone with the guy) and offered no real solutions to my problem.

I think I forgot to mention I also have that weird robot voice issue that many other people were complaining about. At this point I'm most likely just going to say forget it and return these. I hate that this is necessary because I really wanted to like them, but I don't see much of a choice here since astro really dropped the ball on this one.

Hated this game growing up!  I never could land the freaking plane!
Impossible.

I got this game back in the mid 1980s when it came out.  I hated it.  Namely because I never could land the damn plane on the freaking aircraft carrier.

For a mid 1980s game, it's a fairly decent, if boring, flight simulator.  But don't think you'll be getting a real flight simulator.  You just chose your plane, then you you fly in this big boring blue frame for a while, and try to dodge missles.  There's no real music.  That's the whole game.  There are four missions, but I only got to the third mission.  There's a good reason for that.

But what makes this game so notorious for those who remember it (my generation, basically), is landing the plane on the aircraft carrier.  When you land the plane, you get a long approach, in which the game will continually tell you to press up or down on the control pad, to made sure you are aligned properly.  And no matter how meticulously you follow the instructions, YOU ALMOST ALWAYS CRASH.  I can remember being a little kid and getting so frustrated at this game because I could never land.  My brother landed once or twice, but that's about it.

The other bad part is, I think in mission 3, you have to fuel midair when a big fuel plane comes up on top of you.  Just like landing, you have to press up or down to make sure the cable that will transport the gas from the fuel plane to your aircraft is properly aligned.  Just like the landing on the aircraft, you can never make the connection.  If the connection is not made, then the fuel aircraft will break the connection, leaving you to certain death as you will run out of fuel  before you reach the aircraft carrier, which you won't be able to land on anyway.

The reason why I could never get past mission three is, if I remember correctly, you have three lives.  You lose the first two lives on the first two missions because you can't land, then you lose your life because you can't fuel.  I think the fourth mission has to do with a space shuttle, but I never knew any of my friends who had the game to get to that level.

Just a really bad game.  Google Angry Video Game Nerd's review of it, he is, as usual, spot on (beware, he has a lot of adult language to the point his reviews are borderline obscene, but still funny as hell).

I recently purchased and received one of these from gamestop. The battery wouldn't charge at all, no matter what I did. The Wii U menu showed that it was charging on the battery indicator, but it wasn't happening. After looking online to see if others had similar experiences, I found that to be the case. People suggested re-seating the battery as the connection can sometimes be loose. I tried that as well as charging it directly from the wall, as others suggested, bypassing the charging cradle completely. The light would show a constant orange (charging) and then within a few seconds start blinking again.

I tried using the gamepad for a few minutes and the thing died. Apparently for the entire 2 - 3 hour time I had it on the charger, it wasn't getting any juice. It reported going from 2/4 bars upon initial installation to 3/4 and yet apparently gained no actual charge. A few people have suggested the wiring to the connector may be loose, but I can't confirm or deny that personally. I won't be replacing it as I don't trust this product, based on my experience and the experiences I've heard from others with this battery. Maybe I'm being overly cautious, but I'm very hesitant to put an (apparently) poorly made, high capacity third party battery in my $150+ Gamepad. Better safe than sorry, I suppose.

After shooting down a couple of trees the game quickly becomes stale. The suit is useless because you can only use abilities for about 3 seconds. People say that the game is open exploration. Yeah, it is, but there isn't much to explore besides jungle and the occassional Korean outpost. You mostly have one mission and you follow the nav point to get there.

  However, what kills this game is that it does not behave like the original.  For instance it is nearly imposable for you to jump onto a bubble you just shot, which makes a couple of the levels a whole lot harder than they where on NES.  There are also gaps that you should be able to easily shoot your bubbles through, which instead stick to the wall, sadly, this makes it a whole lot easier to die on certain levels.

If you are considering this for the PC, read the above thread first.  This is a terrible port.  The graphics might be great, the story might be good (I don't know this to be true) but the UI and controls are abysmal on the PC.  If you were expecting the series to return to the direction of DAO, this game does not.  If you were looking forward to the tactical camera, you will be disappointed.

Sims 3 was such an improvement over Sims 2, which itself was a huge leap forward from Sims 1. So of course I had to get Sims 4, with great anticipation of the improvements. HAH! I'm now furious that I spent eighty bucks to preorder the Premium Edition Sims 4 and ended up with something akin to Sims 2 for console. It is literally more like an app game.

Everything we loved about Sims 3 is gone! I remember in Sims 1 and 2, the hours wasted on custom content sites, downloading yet another recolor of a dress just so my new sim could have something different to wear. Sims 3 made any recolor possible, for clothing, furnishings, etc. A truly customizable world that sim fans wanted. Well forget that in Sims 4! Nope you will have a handful of color options to choose from for each clothing or furniture style, no color wheel or patterns to customize, and remember the lazy color-blind creators that worked at Sims 1 & 2, who gave us the mint green fridge that didn't quite match the dishwasher? Yep, those design nightmares have returned, so good luck finding things that actually go together! At least we had a dishwasher in Sims2 even if it didn't exactly match the other appliances. No dishwasher in S4, no cars, no laptop... What is the point in giving our sims outfit options (5 possible outfits can be created for each type, ie everyday, formal, etc.) that our sim will randomly choose to wear, when the choices are so limited? Even the hair and makeup that we used to be able to customize to any color, with highlights etc, nope you will have a handful of fake flat hair colors and preset makeups to use. I'm sorry but the removal of the colorwheel and pattern choices, absolutely no valid excuse is acceptable EA! OK so you can pull on the sim's body and shape it, that is cool, but you can't do it to the hair and those choices are ridiculously limited. Frankly I could use the Sims 3 create-a-sim sliders to create as unique of a look that I needed for my game.

Then there is the personality dumbdown in Sims 4. No more favorite colors or foods, and the choices of traits are very lacking. Remember the fun of having an insane, neurotic sim who was afraid of the dark? All you get now is insane. Remember having the ability to make a custom life wish? Pick from a handful now. Ok, maybe I can forgive all that and just enjoy the game play. What the...? Where is the world? It is smaller than the original Sims 1 neighborhood! And you can't even go outside of your sims little area of about 6 lots without TRAVELLING -- remember that dreaded load screen wait in Sims 2 whenever your sim wanted to go visit a friend or the library? It's BAAAAAACK! Seriously? On my system it isn't the 'go make a sandwich and take out the trash' wait of Sims 2 load screens, but why remove the other best thing about Sims 3, the seamless open world?? And forget customizing the world, no world edit is available at all. There are so few empty lots, the new building options are really pointless because there is virtually no place to build anything. If this wasn't enough, I was shocked when my sim went to work, and I couldn't even click on her to view her simology or to see what was in her personal inventory.

In Sims 4, 99% of the game has just been dumbed down to nothing. In game play, the few positives are that the sims can multitask, and you have more family relationship options. There are more social interactions, they take selfies (a lot!), they feel happy or sad, they walk funny if they have to go to the bathroom, in fact you can give your sim a swagger walk or whatever as part of create-a-sim. Little things here and there that are cool, but to me that isn't enough. These should have been in addition to, not instead of, the advancements made in Sims 3. So, like many no doubt, I'm going back to rich and open world of Sims 3, an infinitely better use of my free time than this pathetic excuse for a 2014 game. Too bad I can't get my money back though.

Spellbinding graphics and gameplay gimmicks (night jumps, ""affordances"", weapons 'upgrades', squad control, etc.) seem to be creeping into all these games with no real improvement in the areas that make them fun and, just as importantly, popular for online multiplayer, which is where they see their longevity. Even Activision continues to miss the boat on usable mapping and modding tools - something they could easily market and profit from if they had the interests of their customers at heart (those tools are already developed and lack only a decent user interface and some documentation - much of which already exists in the public domain). Instead of abandoning customers and expecting them to buy a new version of the game every year or so, why not try supporting the games (the good ones) with expansions, mapping/modding tools and resources, etc.?

I'm very anxiously awaiting Call of Duty / Modern Warfare 2, announced by Activision on 12/3. I very much hope it uses the same excellent game engine, and that they don't waste resources developing a new one from scratch (as they obviously have done with WaW).

If we never see another attempt by Treyarch to contribute to the Call of Duty franchise on the PC, that'll be just fine. If Activision wants Treyarch to develop console games for them, great - have them stick to consoles. They obviously have no idea what makes for a good FPS/WWII PC game.",Wait until it goes to the Bargain Bin,1232236800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
171483,2.0,False,"03 1, 2010",A1OUKEY9UYTV3H,B001COTC3E,David Allen,"I've been a gamer now for about 18 years. I've played plenty of games on all types of platforms. I love my PSP as I can take my habit anywhere and get my fix. There have been many games put out for the PSP so far, some really good, and some horrible. Having finished Untold Legends - Brotherhood of The Blade, I was looking for another fun game, but something more current. On searching, I found two games, one of which was Resistance. I always thoroughly read all reviews to get a general feel for the game and what others think about it. I have to say, most got it wrong with this game.

On receiving the game, I read through the manual. I was disappointed straight out of the box. The first thing I look for when searching for a game is if the controls are PSP friendly, and that means, that character movement is completely controlled by the analog stick. Most reviews said that is how the character is controlled in this game. Wrong. On reading the manual, I find that only forward and side to side character control is afforded by the analog stick, and to turn the character you have to use the triangle, circle, square, X pads in conjunction with the analog stick. This was exactly what I wanted to avoid because games that are not modified from the two analog stick control format of the PS2 and PS3 suck on the PSP because you don't have enough fingers to both control the character AND select weapons, AND aim, AND fire at the same time. Proper control on land should be totally by analog stick.

I gave the game a run for its money. I'll be honest, the graphics and art work are excellent, and the story line is interesting. Sounds and music what little there is are very well done. But as one progresses through the levels it becomes increasingly difficult and then impossible to adequately control the character. This first becomes apparent when you try to swim the first time. You get an indicator to press down arrow to dive. OK, fine he goes under the water then what? You have to move the analog stick forward, but if you need to dive further, you have to press the down arrow again, hard to do when your using that hand to move forward. Turning is a joke as you attempt to use the Square and Circle buttons while pushing the analog stick. Down arrow will get you down under and diving, the up arrow button is all but useless as you die, lost and hopelessly disoriented as you've lost all sense of direction. Just to ice the cake they toss in a few Screachers later to attack you while you drown. Frustrating. The proper control set up for swimming should have been forward movement by analog stick and up, down, left, right by the symbol keys.

As you progress you naturally encounter more and more enimies. Most of the earlier enimies are fairly easy, and ammo seems plentiful. Eventually you'll cross paths with an enimie called a Boiler. These lovely creatures look like the aliens you saw in the movie Independence Day. They have thick skin though so you have to shoot them forever to kill them. That uses up all or most of your ammo. The idea is, you shoot them in the head and their head explodes killing them. If you fail to do this, they explode their head of their own accord next to you taking away health. Problem, you cannot maneuver and aim and shoot at the same time because your both hands are having to control the character. You get used to shooting at the same time by pressing the R button, but unless you aim with these guys, be prepared to get blown up. Whoops, cannot aim, using that hand to do two other things, sorry. BOOM! This is a recurring major problem that only gets worse as you play along farther into the game. More enimies, less control, more of you dying instead of them. Half the time your out of ammo, even if you pick most or all of it up that you come across, which is pretty easy to do. Health is usually fairly plentiful, but there are some areas they could have cut you a break and laid one in a corner. There are some campaigns where you don't have any health options, you have to beat the gazillions of enimies overwhelming you or you die first. Again frustrating.

Another poor design cue is with the weapons. There are plenty of weapons to use, and you get most of them in the beginning campaigns. Ammo is fairly plentiful, but because of control issues, you waste so much of it, you find yourself defenseless with useless empty weapons most of the time. A real problem is that each gun has different abilities, and dual capabilities. One for example is a regular gun in default mode, but acts as a grenade launcher in the other mode. The problem is, you have to aim the grenade and most of the time your needing to move while doing it. So that means your left hand is on the analog stick and your right hand is on the symbol keys, and they expect you to move, seek cover, and fire using your right button, but if you want to use the alternate weapon mode you have to press the left button, hold it then press the right button. So unless your a danged octopus, your not using the alternate weapons often. The other frustrating thing is, you eventually learn that for example the LAARK has some pretty good power. So you decide to select it, would you not think that a well designed game would display a tiny box or something with the gun name shown as your selecting weapons? Maybe the ability to press a button to refresh you memory as to what the selected weapon can do. Yes, you would expect that, but not in this game. Your on your own, all you get is a small icon, so unless you can recall in the heat of a battle while getting your butt blown off what the LAARK looked like, your SOL and DEAD.

In the end this game was nothing but a lesson in total frustration. I did not enjoy playing it at all. Every turn was a struggle to control the character and stay alive only to die because the controls flat out suc'd. Designers of games like this where they are too lazy to change the control functions to PSP friendly should be put out of a job, there is no excuse for that type of poor planning and design. I can fully understand now why this game in spite of all of the glowing reviews was marked down to $14.99, still $14 too high in my opinion. Do not waste your time or hard earned money on this turd, buy God Of War first, now that is an incredible game.","High Hopes, Low Rating....",1267401600,10,{'Platform:': ' Sony PSP'},

18491,2.0,False,"12 17, 2004",A2AV2TR28DGSGC,B00004WLMA,ajnrules,"Maybe it is just me, but I feel that WWF No Mercy is the one that most appeals to a limited crowd. From what I see, it's either you enjoy wrestling and love this game, or you hate/couldn't care less about wrestling and you don't. I happen to be in the latter category, and so I feel that there is nothing about this game that I really enjoy. I really don't think there are anything in this game that would appeal to other non-wrestling-fans except for the fact that it is easy to pick up and play. Being a non-wrestling fan, I don't really understand what exactly the crowd meter thingy is for. You could be beating the life out of the opposing wrestler, yet your relation with the crowd is relatively low. I highly doubt that any other non-wrestling-fans would know what it is either.

That is not to say that there is nothing fun about this game. As I said, the game is very easy to pick up and play. After a few rounds of button mashing, you would be able to figure out that A is to grapple and do whatever other attacks you have, and B is to just beat the living crud out of each and every one of your opponents. Yet if you are not familiar with how to end a match, then you'll likely just attack for a while until your opponent gets seriously bloody. Constantly pressing B just to turn your opponent into a bloody mess gets old if you keep on doing it for several minutes. And controlling characters on a semi-3D environment just does not feel natural. Sure, I don't mind the fact that the game keeps you locked onto an opponent at all times, but it is moving around that gets tedious.

WWF No Mercy was probably the most realistic wrestling game back in 2000. There are authentic entrances with authentic entrance music as well as authentic game modes. Yet to be completely honest, I don't really care. The graphics are more gritty and realistic than Asmik Ace and Aki's previous two wrestling games (1998's WCW/nWo Revenge and 1999's WWF Wrestlemania 2000), and the characters models don't look like faces painted on blobs like earler wrestling games. In other words, they actually look like people this time around. However, they still don't look very good. Stephanie McMahon looks like a zombie, or somebody really ugly wearing a lot of makeup. Crowds are no better than previous Asmik Ace/AKI wrestling games. They don't look like cardboard anymore, but they are just really ugly, really pixelated sprites instead. Sound effects are a bit laughable. It's just ""BOOM! KAPAM KAPOW!"" Yeah. It's not that I have anything against this game, but I just don't find it that good. It still is the best of the Asmik Ace/Aki wrestling games. Maybe I would appreciate it more if I actually watch wrestling.

As you may be a fan and you may have read the foregone warning that there was only going to be  "" some content""  to start the game off.... it will throw you off to the point where you are going to wonder why you bought it in the first place.

Right now it feels like  BETA 2.0  -  there is just nothing there folks but re-hash plays upon the same Paris scene over and over ---- with increasing difficult and so on, so fourth.

It is however --- Hitman... but if you are like me that apperciates a well put together story of "" some kind"".... you'll be a bit taken back and lost. Its sort of like pre-eating a cake before it becomes one and then not really being hungry when it finally gets taken out of the oven.

I've read the increasingly wonderful  game community's reaction when one points this out --- apparently, everyone is stupid and ignorant for buying the product and not reading.....though it doesn't take from the fact that the game is hurting in reviews due to such an idea.  Its an interesting idea for sure --- why not have an incrementally expanding game? ---- there is just one catch.  You have to make it interesting and gravitating for people to give a damn about it.  How many times do you have to go through the same level and keep yourself interested?  This is not like waiting for the next season of  The Walking Dead or  Better Call Saul .... its  a paper-thin experience,  hoping that small tweaks and changing up the "" target""  through different NPC's is going to make you want to patron the game.

One mission?  I would think if I wanted to do something like this properly, I'd have a gripping story that immerses you into the intrigue and world of 47, give you about  3  missions to play through with a "" OMG!""  cliffhanger.  You don't get that with this one folks.  Its you and the same scenario.  Over...and over...and over...

I at least thought they were going to make an effort in that direction but my bet has came up short.

If you are really liking how this game looks, it is my personal opinion that you wait for  Enix to bring fourth more missions than buy it right now.  You are going to feel disappointed.  I won't be like the legion of trolls on  Steam  telling you to  get lost,  your stupid,  or that you have an education level of a neanderthal  --- I'm telling you like a respectful gamer.  Wait for more content.  Right now it isn't worth your money.  You would be doing a better justice by hanging out a friends house and playing this one mission before shelling out cash.  The more people do that, the more we are just buying into bad habits and money-grubbing ideas.  Its bad enough we've bought into buying games in  Alpha-Tests.

presentation -
artwork was nicely done, graphics done pretty well, the videos cut scenes were fine, the voice overs were good, especially the Mirror (host) & Disney style trash talking from the characters in the game towards each other or at the player controlling them. Such as, ""did you fall asleep?"", ""Great job"", ""Oh, that was bad"" ""I'm going to win, donkey"" ""I'll beat you, Shrek"", etc. Unfortunately there is only a limited amount of them & it can get annoying, though better then nothing. In the games there are always 4 characters even if 3 are AI (yes, you can skip the AI turns).
Menu/options -
menu is simple, you choose a character (Fiona, one of babies, charming, etc.). It has multi-player & tournament besides the career/story mode to unlock the games. There are 6 different sections with the last being locked. Each section has about 5 games & 2 or 3 which are locked. The game seems to skewed towards letting the player win over the A.I. Several games have shooting by targeting & then flick of the wrist as well as a lot of running, or even just pumping the nunchuck or wii remote in a game to get power such as hammer throw in strength test.
bugs -
The 1st time I rented, the hoopla which is a javelin game you run & then using wii remote turning you guide it through flaming hoops as it sails to a target pic of prince charming. playing as baby of Shrek, I couldn't win after many attempts, but when I played at fiona, I had no problem wining the first time. in the hammer throw I couldn't get the power meter up & in a tricycle around a track, I couldn't steer, though luckily you can't fall off & I won easily anyhow. In climbing Rapunzel's hair, I had no trouble moving w/baby, but using Fiona it wouldn't register even button pushes. the bowling w/hitting wooden dwarfs w/melons I couldn't do more then a very weak throw. when I was back at the menu, I lost the pointer/IR totally. thinking a fluke, I tried shooting game that beat previously easily & that wouldn't register. I restarted the wii 2x & it still would not work. I took out the disk, but a totally different shooting game disc & that worked fine.
The game does get boring though from repetition, too simple gameplay & it's too easy, though it has a few gem ideas like hoopla/javelin & a pong/soccer game. it is colorful, upbeat, cute w/humor, but the game programing is feels lazily done.
this game would be good for young kids who like Shrek & can get this at a bargain price.

Now, 4 COD's later, this thing is plain old and boring. The makers of the series did a smart thing with COD 4 Modern Warfare,the game brought new technology, scenarios and situations to the genre, and it was excellent fun, a good rest from the back to back world war II shooters that had been beaten to death.

Now with world at war, they again resort to the same old formula, and one that only took them a year to launch after COD 4 was released, probably meaning so much of it is a rehash of what they've done a million times before, that it didn't even take them much of an effort to make.

Aside from the gameplay, story and situations being just extremely boring and old, there ain't much to look at graphics wise, they basically used the same engine from COD 4, which is not a bad engine, but it's over a year old and doesn't bring anything amazing to the table.

1. Find some reviews of F.E.A.R. that have screens.

2. IGNORE the foregrounds that show flashy effects and character models and just look at the background environments

3. Now go find screens of Quake 4, Doom 3, HL2 or just about any other newish shooter and compare their environments.

4. Shake your head in stunned disbelief about how everyone says this game has the best graphics.

You'll be spending 80 percent of the game looking at those environment graphics which are dull, dull dull. And I'm not some teenage kid who plays so many games that only the very latest graphics will do.  Just show me some stuff I DON'T SEE EVERY DAY is all I ask. Newsflash for Monolith Productions--some of us have jobs and have to look at corporate offices all day, maybe sticking us in that same environment for 7 hours isn't the best choice.

A huge part of why I enjoy video games is for the escapism and sense of exploration.  F.E.A.R. just doesn't give a fig about any of this.  The environments are so generic it affects the game play--I constantly couldn't tell if I'd entered a new area because it all looked the same.  That leads to a lot of wrong turns and backtracking through levels.  Playing Quake 4 after this was like jumping 3 years ahead.

Also, all the other criticsms here about the story are right on target.  F.E.A.R. tries to be kind of a shooter Silent Hill--which would be great if it succeded at all in those terms (please, somebody make a good one!).  But the story is really an afterthought tacked on top of a game that's really just a series of firefights.  If you're expecting supernatural monsters to play any appreciable role in this game you'll be dissapointed.

You should only buy this game if enemy AI is your first priority.  And then only if you plan to play it on the hardest difficulty settings where the AI is most active. Gamers looking for any sense of exporation, escapism, or storyline should look elswhere.  I really wanted to like this game.  Shooters with supernatural themes are my favorite.

It's very easy to use and setup and the charge seems to last a long time (since receiving it I've only charged it the initial time and haven't had to recharge it yet).
The wireless range is excellent, with the instructions stating 30 feet although it as a test I had it out to nearly 40 feet and it was still functioning fine.  Voice communication through the headset is also very good.  The front half of the headset swings inwards towards your cheek/mouth to help cut or at least reduce ambiant noise and this works well.
So operationally this is really quite a good headset.  However with headsets perhaps the number one factor has to be comfort is this is where the Tritton is let down horribly.
The earpiece is too big (bith with and without the rubber cover) and the ear hook to keep it in place is terrible.  It actually pinches your ear, is not very flexable and is just clipped onto the actual headset so I wouldn't rate it's durability very well either.
The recharging base is USB, therefore needs to be plugged into a computer or similar to draw power.  You can't just plug it straight into a wall socket.

1. Lifespan
2. Warranty and service related to that warranty

The G910 Orion Spark is a $180 mechanical keyboard that tries to be the best and comes with a pricetag that boasts that it really must be. However this keyboard is plagued with firmware issues that cannot be rolled back, uninstalled or reset as well as switches that are prone to dirt collection with no realistic way to dust or clean. It lasted me 9 months before it became totally impossible to type and game with. After less than a year keys double input and fail to even type, type when not even pressed and keyboard fails to power on sometimes at bootup.

I've been a long-time Logitech fanboy because they made great products that lasted and had reliable service. Not only does Logitech NOT even have a phone number to call anymore, they would not honor my warranty on a short-lived enthusiast peripheral that cost as much as my processor! I was forced to choose to either email or chat, so I chose chat knowing emails would take weeks to resolve my issue. I was greeted 45 minutes later on a Monday afternoon by a foreign man who said Hi then disappeared for 6 minutes. After several responses where he took 6 minutes to respond every time another 45 minutes went by concluding that he would not honor my warranty for bogus reasons that he claimed did not live up to warranty status.

For anyone considering Logitech be warned, they no longer are the company you loved and outsourced their customer support to other countries, and now cut corners on warranties based on petty rules. They do not believe in excellency. No amount of previous loyalty will matter. It won't matter if you have 12 products registered on their site because they don't care.

Updated review:
So after playing this game for a while I have to downgrade my review. The ""story"" was very weak and there is no connection felt to your character. This game had so much potential to have a great, personal story but they really dropped the ball.
The highlight of the game is supposed to be the dark zone, but glitches and hacks have made this almost totally impossible to play and is not any fun. You are constantly hunted by packs of rogue enemies who have obviously taken advantage of the games exploits. Getting killed in one shot and having the pack of rogues just wait outside the spawn to kill you again is dumb and just makes you want to quit. I am very disappointed because this game could've been great, but Ubisoft has failed. What's worse is it seems like every time they try to fix something with a patch they just create another exploit or bug.

The combat is better.  The music is more generic, but in a series that requires this much grinding, I'm not complaining about that (the chaotic discord of the original Drakengard's soundtrack really gets on your nerves after a while).  The camera is MUCH better than its predecessor.  It's set in the same world as Drakengard, and I give Drakengard 4 stars, so one would wonder why I would rate this so much lower, with all the improvements.

The answer is the linchpin of what made Drakengard so beloved by me: The story.  If you have played the original, and happen to remember the story, give this game a wide berth.

In Drakengard 1, we get Caim, who is silent and not as heroic as we initially believe.  Indeed, almost all characters in Drakengard 1 had several layers to them, that you had to dig to reveal.  Do not expect the same type of characters in Drakengard 2.  You get Nowe, who is the typical anime protaganist (which does NOT fit in Drakengards world).  You have his childhood lady friend, who wants him.  You have Manah, who was a little girl in the first game.  Nowe wants her.  You also have Urick, a dude who has a pact with the Grim Reaper.  There is almost no depth to any of them, but if utilized properly, this could work out alright.  Not great, but decently.

And then Drakengard 2 has the player systematically do things that anyone who played Drakengard 1 would be screaming at the cast to not do.  I won't go into spoilers,  But if you played Drakengard 1, the entire game will be you saying to yourself, ""This is stupid.  I know what's coming.  Why would they do this?  Why does nobody try to explain the consequences of their actions?""

Then, when said consequences come to pass, the game splits off into 3 different endings, depending on what level you are playing the game on.  Everyone starts the game on normal, then moves onto Hard, and finally Extreme.  That means, in order to get all the endings, you don't just go down alternate paths like you did in Drakengard 1.  You have to play the entire game 3 full times.  In Extreme difficulty, the first enemy in the tutorial will kill you in two hits.  Some of these levels are around an hour long, and are filled with thousands of enemies.

But I beat it all 3 times.  Minus the last hour of each 40+hour playthrough, there is perhaps 10 minutes of new dialoge per run (and I'm being VERY liberal in my estimate, there).  You have to commit to playing 40+hours of a game in which you won't like the characters (if you've played Drakengard 1) THREE FULL TIMES in order to get the true ending, which really sucks anyways.

If you haven't played the original Drakengard, this would be an average hack-n-slash game, with boring, forgettable characters.  But if you've played Drakengard, skip this one, and move on to NieR, a Drakengard sequel based off Ending E in Drakengard.  It's much, MUCH better.",Not worth your time if you've played the original Drakengard,1386201600,5,,

The actual fighting is pretty good: You get tired and need to rest, need to block and dodge based on what's coming at you, and can stun your opponent giving you another opening.  These are things that make a boxing game more realistic and after a bit of learning I'm starting to enjoy myself in the ring.  This is why I have the fun set pretty high, if all I care about is fighting (which is probably the case for a lot of people), it's pretty fun.

That's where the fun ends, however.  The actual story mode appears to be completely lineal.  I had gotten the idea that'd I'd be making decisions along the way: Do I party or train?  Fight a guy for the money or look for a real challenge?  Instead it's whether I won or lost, and even that doesn't appear to disrupt my career too much.  Listening to assorted people tell my story is pretty cool... for a few minutes.  Then it gets downright monotonous.

The training mode takes everything good I've seen from other games, and throws it out the window.  While it has some good points (heavy bag is pretty fun), it makes other things almost unbearable.  I tried combination punching and got miss after miss even though I knew I was throwing the right punches at the right time.  Doesn't make me want to keep trying.  But supposedly training (that is, training well) will make your stats go up in career mode, so it's hard to avoid doing it.

Whoever wrote the manual needs to get their facts straight about some of the boxers featured in the game.  I was stunned at some of the stuff I was reading because it's completely wrong, or at least out of date.  This doesn't affect the gameplay but lowers my opinion of 2K Sports.

The gameplay is linear and stagnant.  - ""Fight these three brown ninjas! Here comes a white ninja! - Fight this monster, oh wait, more ninjas!!""  About the only rewarding feeling while playing the game was getting to run up walls and flip over people onto ledges etc.  But you can't have fun flipping around all day long because that damn ""random ninja generator"" is cranked to 11, and wave after wave of generic ninjas will keep attacking you as you play.  - So you can't enjoy the wall hopping without having to participate in Ninja Gaiden's stale fighting system.

**There is no ragdoll and the ninja's, when killed, die in about the same three or four poses.  This makes for very monotonous gameplay.  They attack the same way, and then they die the same way.

The bosses, as I'm sure you've heard, are ridiculously hard.  But not in a fun advanced AI sense, where you feel the joy of battle... No, I'm afraid not at all.  The bosses are hard in the sense that they know what you are about to do before you do it, and constantly thwart your every attempt to attack them.  To defeat the bosses, you have to waste about 6 or 7 tries finding out what moves not to do, and what pattern it's okay to attack in.  To me, that's not a fun challenge.. that's more of a math equation done with an Xbox controller instead of a calculator.  Tecmo thinks it's funny to waste our time ;)

I can see the challenge of them but make it so you can see the gates instead of making them so small or hidden you can't see what is what until its too late. And then we have the ""Kudos vs Time"" races which take ""idiotic"" to a whole new dimension. Do one or the other not both and if you feel the need to be a moron then at least make it so you can perform a power slide or earn kudos in a ""grip"" car or a ""drift"". They take all the choices away from you and instead of being able to choose which car you will use for which track and race they make you choose one and that is what you are stuck with. I liked the arcade racing PGRs better and this one is the worst of the series in my opinion because it can't make up its mind on whether it wants to be a sim or arcade racing game. They do have some cool cars and the graphics are first rate but that does not fix the fundamental problem it has with its own identity. There is a reason why this was the last PGR game made. As the old saying goes ""if it aint broke don't fix it!"". The series was not broke until this game and they broke it good. After playing this for a while I cannot say enough bad things about this game! The tracks are idiotic and they throw in stupid weather tricks that are best left to moronic developers like EA games. What little fun is left in this game is sucked out by the fact that whoever did work on this game should be banned for life from even going near a console let alone making a game! This is one of the absolutely lamest and worst driving games I have ever played! The responses are slow and the challenges are just not fun or challenging. Save your money and buy a real game.

Some dissapointments I had were that they took the challenge plays mode out.  Boy, do you want to challenge a play when a defensive lineman hits you when are throwing the ball...so instead of a forward pass incomplete, you get a fumble and they run it back for a touchdown...very frustrating.  Besides that, EA took a lot of other features of game playing out...John Madden himself is not even the announcer now (unless you call his plays when play calling).

There are many more they left out of the game, but one of my other biggie was there is NO vibration feedback at all!

The levels that were enjoyed were those where you need to pick your spots and shoot the bad guys.  This doesn't mean camping out and sniping - that usually won't happen because the bad guys are quite aggressive in their storming your position - but also because the designers like to create spawn points that are almost always in a place that is right on top of any spot.  So, for some of the levels, you are basically shooting one wave only to be taken over by the next wave, dying, and figuring out what the ""signal"" for the next spawn is so you can move - and their spawning points are usually ridiculously unrealistic.  That's the main problem - they attempt at realism in various scenarios removes most of the fun from the game.

Moving is co-number one issue with this game.  Yeah, the visuals are pretty and there is a lot to see. If - big IF - if you only had time to actually stop and look at the scenery, the buildings crashing down, etc.  To stay in one spot in this game too long is to die, even if you think you are perfectly hidden.  They always seemt to know where you are.

So, you gotta move.  And moving is dangerous.  Why?

Because the game mechanics of close-up combat are ridiculously awful.  So awful that it ruins everything.  There are a lot of complaints about the controls.  I don't think its the controls as much as the mechanics implemented to be, assumingly, more realistic.  And if that's not the case, then yeah - the controls suck.  But the mechanics are awful, and awfully inconsistent, and the AI is such that in tandem with the controls and/or mechanics, if a dude is anywhere within the range of your shotgun, you have a more-than-good chance of death.

The accuracy of shooting is seemingly completely random as well, as is the effect of the shot on the enemy.  I can't tell you how many dudes survive what looked like head-shots of the shotgun up-close (especially the flamethrowers).

And when you do hit them, except for the random headshot (I finally figured it was totally random and had nothing to do with aim)they will howl in pain or lie down, stand there in a daze, BUT THEY ALMOST SEEM INVINCIBLE when they are writhing in agony (usually just long enough for your reload to finish and you to fire off a shot that's perfectly late)",Visuals vs. Mechanics,1243468800,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

No, it's a repackage of a product that's been sold since 2009 in North America. AtGames is a Chinese company, though you won't find it mentioned anywhere on there website. But it becomes apparent when you see how little information is given in English on their products. AtGames has been manufacturing a product that plays Sega Genesis cartridges since 2003 as far as I can tell, starting overseas, gaining an official Sega license along the way (around 2007 or so), and then they brought it over for a official launch in North America (though you could find them since 2009 in different forms). You'll see this same hardware called different names over the years (the Mega X-3, the Firecore system), but 2012 was the first time that AtGames actually made more of a marketing push and started using somewhat professional packaging, including the Sega Genesis logo and a few actual game characters. They also have separate Genesis and Master System handheld portable systems they've been selling since about 2011. For 2016 they redesigned the packaging again (though its labeled as the 2015 version), and are hoping you pick one up when you're looking for that NES Classic Edition console. Each year the games that were included got slight revisions, like for 2016 we got the three Mortal Kombat games (along with a few others), but the low-quality controllers and console itself really haven't changed year to year.

THE PRODUCT: It may say ""80-90 Games"" on the packaging, but this is misleading, as you typically only get 40 Genesis game, and 40+ self-published titles that could best be described as homebrew games (think of the contents of Action 52 and you'll understand). The biggest complaint gamers have is that the EMULATION IS ONLY 90-95%! This is your standard console-on-a-chip, and you'll find the sound is often presented at the wrong hertz (listen to the Sonic the Hedgehog start-up music and any long-time fans will spot the ""off-key"" music, as it is sometimes called). Sonic himself also doesn't quite reach the speeds he normally does, though it's close. Colors can often be off in areas as well. Some people may not notice these little differences, but for the hardcore its a deal-breaker. AtGames has only made slight changes over the years with its emulation, so it probably won't get noticeably better any time soon. It really is the same unit in the box for the last several years, despite what they show.

The console itself only offers MONO SOUND, but the game slot is big enough to accept ALL North American, European and Japanese games, so this unit is REGION FREE. This unit has NEVER had an HDMI port on it. Your standard composite A/V cables are your only option for video. There were some units that had an SD slot in 2012, which means you could take a 2GB or 4GB SD Card and put all the Genesis/MegaDrive games you want and play them. But over the last year or so I'm not sure if they still manufacture this version, so be aware. Definitely a nice feature if you find it, but you'll need to convert them to the .bin format, and put them in a folder marked ""games"" or it won't work. There should be some more detailed instructions on the internet for those that need them.

NO SAVE FEATURE: The next biggest complaint is the complete lack of a save feature, even if you have your games on an SD Card. AtGames NEVER discloses this information on any of its products, but you should know it ahead of time (the website may have been updated, but the packaging itself never indicates it). Unless someone knows for certain they have one that does, but I doubt it. All previous versions don't let you save. For a lot of games this really doesn't matter, but it means that any game that featured a battery back-up needs to be finished in one sitting (namely RPGs, like Phantasy Star 2). And even if you put in the real physical cartridge to a game that has a working battery back-up -- the save feature STILL WONT WORK. It seems that only an original Genesis/MegaDrive console and the Retron 3 system will actually save your progress to the cartridge. If you come back to one of these games, only the saves that were previously made will be present, regardless of the progress you made, and even if the system says the save was successful. Games that use passwords are obviously unaffected.

BOTTOM LINE:
The more casual gamers may not mind the negatives. This console has many of the same limitations as the Genesis 3: you can't use a Game Genie, Sonic & Knuckles won't recognize the game you plug on top of it, and some other games just won't work. Be sure that the unit you get still has controller ports because the packages that include a couple of wireless controllers have many problems. They use Infrared light and many people have reported problems with button delays, especially when using both at the same time. The slight sound and graphical deviations may not be noticed as much if you haven't played many of these games in nearly 20 years, and not being able to save may not be a big deal since many games don't require it anyway, and those that offer a password feature can still be played like normal. Its also very nice to have a simple Genesis-clone with the ability to plug in any official Genesis controllers, and a way to take the entire Genesis/MegaDrive collection on a SD Card if you wish (if able). Perfect for some nostalgic gaming if you're on the go, or you need to be away from your main gamming collection for a few days. Just throw this thing in your backpack and you're all set. The list price is often $60, but you should still find it for around $40 new at Walgren's, Family Dollar and SafeRite stores. Be wary of those $100 prices.

The more hardcore gamers will hate the quality of the emulation, having the sound being off so much will make it impossible to play for some, not to mention some areas will have the wrong-color sprites, and some games just plain won't work. The emulation doesn't include Sega CD / Mega CD or the 32X compatibility, you can't save in-game, and you can't even use the emulator itself to create save-states. Having mono-sound is also a bummer. The price may be attractive, but there's a reason why the big retailers don't carry the product. Its a cheaply manufactured product meant to be sold in Third-World countries alongside other knock-off products. The official Sega license is nice, but many of the games are the same as on ""Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection"" (PS3, Xbox360), so just get that. Nowadays you're probably better off bringing your laptop with you, complete with a decent Genesis emulator, a collection of ROMs, and a digital controller so you don't need to use the keyboard to play. You won't have a cartridge slot, but it will be more authentic.","Casual Gamers may Like It, but Hardcore Gamers Will Hate It",1470960000,,,

Original review:

I love Halo, but this game needs A LOT of work. It hardly worked when it came out, and each update seems to break it even more for me. Multiplayer? I have had so many troubles getting into games that I don't even bother with it. I have an open NAT, so that should be no problem.

On release day, one of my friends who has never had the pleasure of playing Halo:CE, Halo 2 campaign, or Halo 4 wanted to just start with CE and beat every single player all the way through Halo 4. I was all excited for it. I had done the digital order from the Microsoft Store, and mine took another hour or so to do the 15GB day one patch. He purchased his copy at a brick and mortar retailer. It took him 5 hours to install his game and get the patch done(he is on a 60mbps internet connection). I know several other people that have had the same issue. That is inexcusable.

After he finally managed to get it installed, we decided to start playing the Halo:CE campaign. I was the host, and he joined me. I started the game. He got disconnected from the game. We both have open NATs, so we can't see that being any problem. We decided to try again. This time, it worked...for 2 missions. After the second mission, we got disconnected again. Now, I understand this is on release night, and there may be some minor issues, so I was okay with it.

Fast forward a couple days. An update is released. After the update, we expect some of the issues to be gone. HAHAHAHA! How wrong could we be? Now, it took us 4 tries to get a game going. To be fair, after we got the game going, we were able to play all the way to the end of the game without being disconnected. As soon as we beat it, he was disconnected(and didn't get the achievement for beating it). We tried the last level again...same thing when we beat it.

Fast forward a few more days. Now it is taking us anywhere between 7 and 10 tries to connect to each other. It is getting worse before it is getting better.

I am EXTREMELY disappointed in this game. I gave it 3 stars because the game DOES have a functional single player and it is beautiful to play. I just keep hoping it will get better and not be garbage for multiplayer.","I love halo, but....",1417132800,8,,

87339,2.0,False,"07 25, 2011",A1IQV6AI7L9NOK,B000G75AXE,Feelah the tigress,"I'm a longtime fan of the traditional pokemon games (like Pokemon Pearl and Diamond), so when I saw this spin-off, I was pretty excited.  Unfortunately, it took me a long time to actually get around to playing this game (various reasons I won't go into).  It seems with Pokemon Ranger that they were looking to emphasize the RPG gameplay a bit more than the monster-raising aspects.  Well, I was excited to play this, but unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish the game.  I normally do not write reviews for games I haven't finished, but I feel I need to write a review on this to warn people who may be unable to finish for the same reason I did.  Just check the gameplay section for those details...  Since I got roughly half-way through the game, every other category's judgment is based on that experience.

Graphics (score 7/10): Graphics aren't too bad at all.  In fact, they look better than the traditional Pokemon games, even the most recent Pokemon Black and White.  The character models are just more detailed looking and actually have more animations.  Compared to games on the DS in general, the graphics are pretty average looking; nothing too special but also nothing bad.

Music (score 7/10): Once again, ""average"" is the word of choice I'd use to describe this category.  The music is pretty standard fare for anyone who's familiar with Pokemon games.  It's just simple, but pleasant, ambient RPG-esque tunes.  Nothing irritating, but nothing that stands out too much either.

Characters (score 7/10): Well, as is par for the course for Pokemon games, the characters are pretty simplistic.  You have your ubiquitous ""Professor"" character, and several NPCs.  You can choose which gender you prefer to be, but either way, your protagonist doesn't have much personality.  The rest of the characters have a bit more personality, but not much compared to real RPGs.  Of course, the pokemon series was always aimed at children, and as such, have pretty simple characters, so I can't really mark off too many points in this category.

Story (score 7/10): Well, I've only managed to experience half of the story, but I've played all the traditional pokemon games so I already know what to expect.  Basically, it's the same old formula with your protagonist, a criminal organization (the Go-Rock Squad) who's hilariously incompetent, themes of friendship with pokemon, etc.  The story is moved forward by going on missions.  Basically, you are a new Ranger and the Ranger Station just gives you missions to complete.  These missions will consist of something like ""go into the forest and rescue a lost person"".  Once you finish one mission, the story moves forward and you get another mission.  That's about it.  The story is sub-par compared to the average RPG, but for a pokemon game, it's pretty average.

Gameplay (score 4/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Well, here it is - the category that made me stop playing the game.  This pokemon game differs from the traditional ones in a major way - there are no turn-based battles.  Instead, you can capture ""friend"" pokemon using the stylus by drawing loops around them on the touchscreen.  You also don't get to keep any of the pokemon that you capture.  They stay temporarily as you work on missions and leave once the mission is done.  You'll also need to capture certain pokemon to clear environmental obstacles (like using a cyndaquil to burn a log blocking your path).  As for the stylus capturing method, this is really what got me.  At first, it wasn't bad at all.  In fact, I thought the new gameplay mechanic was fresh and interesting.  However, as soon as I got to the section with the Jungle Relic and the trials, the difficulty spikes immensely.  I really was caught off guard.  You can't use any friend pokemon to help you in here, leaving you with only your partner pokemon who's completely ineffectual for these difficult captures.  I've tried about twenty times, and I just can't do it.  I even went seeking some FAQs to see if there was some great technique I was missing or something, but they all just said things like ""be fast and good luck"".  Yeah, thanks for that.  I physically cannot go any faster, and I'm afraid to just go crazy with the thing anyways lest I scratch my lovely DS screen.  I've had the thing for five whole years now and there isn't a single scratch on the screen, and I'll be darned if I cause one now!  I'll be honest here, maybe I'm just a crappy gamer and that's why I can't do it.  I've primarily been a connoisseur of turn-based RPGs and point-and-click adventure games up to this point since I just don't have good reflexes.  While I have a large number of games in my collection and count myself a serious gamer (I've finished and reviewed over sixty games), I just can't play certain types of games.  Normally I'd just chalk up this game as not being bad in and of itself, but just too hard for me.  No hard feelings and such.  However, this game is specifically aimed towards kids.  I feel that the difficulty level is unfair for them regardless of whether I can finish the game or not.  Not to mention, even if it didn't get so difficult, the gameplay would soon grow pretty stale and repetitive since it's a simple mechanic without much depth to it.

Overall (score 4/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  I don't normally dock a game score this low when there's not much wrong with it, but being unable to finish a game really detracts for me.  Plus, I really just can't recommend this game to anyone.  Kids are quickly going to get frustrated with it's difficulty, and fans of the deep battle mechanics from the other pokemon games are not going to find much here to satisfy them.  The storyline isn't going to win any awards, and the gameplay (even if it isn't too hard for you) is just repetitive and tedious.  I find myself unable to really recommend this to anyone.  If you are a long-time fan of the pokemon franchise, just play Black and White until a new generation comes out and skip Pokemon Ranger altogether.  If you are new to pokemon, definitely don't start with this game.  Try one of the more traditional pokemon games; you'll have much more enjoyable gameplay that will give you a much deeper, more cerebral experience as you plan teams and battle strategies and such.  Just pick up Pokemon Black, White, Pearl, Diamond, Platinum, Heart Gold, or Soul Silver instead of this spin-off.  I guarantee one of those will bring you a much more fulfilling experience than Pokemon Ranger would.","Sadly, I Wasn't Able To Finish This Game...",1311552000,,,

While it wasn't so easy to learn how to set it up at first, with a little patience for the learning curve you will be glad you made the purchase.
The steady-aim, hair trigger, quick scope, dropshot, anti-recoil, just all of it....all the mods and remapping are great.

I use the rapid fire to my benefit in COD when I run with just a pistol..it gives your advantage back when people come at you with assault rifles..let's just say they don't like to view a killcam with a 1911 gunning them down in rapid succession with zero recoil. That alone makes the price tag worthwhile.
For those of you who can't put the sniper rifles down, you'll also love this as much as I hate you... a quick double tap on the left trigger makes for an instant and accurate quickscope every single time.

And Metriod other M was sopposed to be no exception because of how legendary the fanbase is and the fact that everybody waited years since the gamecube release(which was not bad at all really). Let us go further on to the point and explain why you should skip Metriod other M, and instead buy the classic gamecube version(15 dollars) and the SNES for WII Virtual console(15 dollars) besides you can play Metriod from gamecube on the WII.

I played the whole entire game, there were 5 of the same enemy types the WHOLE ENTIRE GAME, which means all the enemies were generic in the fact that you travel through each element and it is the same monster painted differently but they use different elements which could give it replayability but in essence falls short due to lack of variation OF enemies.

Last but not least is the cutscenes with robotic dialougue and uninspired voice acting which did not make me want to listen after playing for the first hour and a hafl. Also what will make most of the Metriod community mad is the fact you have to wait until you are authorized to use some of your weapons, yes you heard me right, AUTHORIZED because in the beginning Samus joins forces with the galactic police and the head officer has to authorize even though Samus is a lone bounty hunter. But the reason is because somehow there are hidden items and he needs to restrict you over time until he authorizes it.

Nice try Team Ninja, no offense, but you RUINED this game, you are not clever, and you owe the gaming world an apology. Excellent graphics and good diolugue do not get you anywhere with this series, this is METRIOD. The fans desearved better than this, and of course this will get alot of sales because of the LOYALTY fans have, but fans will realize that this is Team Ninja's fault for not putting enough effort into different enemies, bad controls etc. All i can tell Team Ninja or anybody in their staff is to go back to making Ninja Gaiden and Dead Or Alive those are the only games you guys are auctully above average on.

Also to Nintendo, they should have let Silicon Knights do a remake, or a sequel down the road, they certainly did a great job with Metal Gear Solid Twin Snakes(Technically a remake) for the gamecube.

I bought it a couple months ago after reading all the good reviews and thinking this game must be a shining gem that has withstood the test of time.  Well, now I'm rethinking that assumption... No doubt many people will disagree with me, but on with the review!

Graphics (6/10): Sigh. Everything is pixelated. I'm not sure whether the graphics for this game were considered good when the game was released or not. On the bright side, the character designs are good as well as the towns.  The dungeons are another matter, but more on that later.

Music (6/10): I still can't figure out why people claim this game has a great soundtrack.  I've even heard people claim that Grandia's music is some of their most favorite of all time.  I wonder if Grandia is the only RPG they've ever played?  Anyway, the majority of the tracks weren't too bad. Unfortuneately, I remember some pretty bad ones.  There's one jungle where the ""music"" seems to only be ambient jungle wildlife sounds, which got annoying after the 50th bird call.  Unlike others, I found the Gumbo song to be one of the most annoying village themes ever.  It's okay right at first, but then starts to grate on your nerves the longer you stay in the village.  One more thing-the voice acting deserves mention.  It's bad.  I rank it as the worst voiceing I've ever heard in a game.  It sounds like they literally pulled people off the street and offered them $10 to read off some lines. Terrible.

Characters (7/10): The characters are interesting at first, until you realize that everyone's the same.  All possess the same plucky, happy-go-lucky adventurer personality.  I have nothing against light-hearted games, but everyone really did seem to have the exact same personality; there was just no balance to the party.  Speaking of party, there was a high rate of people joining and then permanently leaving, this (or something else?) really meant that no one really got any siginificant character development.  Most everyone had no back story of interest (or at all) and were not well developed.

Story (5/10): Here's where Grandia really starts to ""sag in the saddle"", so to speak.  The first 1/4 of the game and the last 1/4 are interesting and engaging.  I really enjoyed the start in Parm; rummaging through people's houses, reading Justin's diary for some amusing stories, and laughing at the way any alcoholic references were changed to ""coffee"".  Man, those were good times.  Unfortunately, it all goes downhill from there.  The middle of the game becomes a neverending series of filler events.  The first couple ""villages in need"" or ""musty old ruins to explore"" didn't bother me at all, but after that, I started to feel like I was stuck on the wheel of karma or something.  It just got really repetitive, until I just knew the next village I came to would have to be saved by me from some disaster.  Well, what I refer to as the ""main"" story picked about the last quarter of the game, but it wasn't nearly original or interesting enough to make up for the huge amount of filler crap in the middle.  By then, only my sheer will power kept me playing to the end.

Battle System (8/10): Nothing really wrong with the battle system.  It's a variant of turn-based, with a small bar in the corner indicating who will go next.  While the bar does let you see when you're characters will go, I didn't really find it all that useful.  What keeps this section from a perfect score is the abilities-and how you level them up.  Using them over and over again strengthens your magic, but not how you'd expect. SPEED increases, not strength.  I found this very frustrating and pointless. The speed doesn't really increase enough to make much difference- and leveling spells takes forever.

Gameplay (4/10): Was the rotating camera really necessary? I've played games with rotating camera angles (like Xenogears) that worked just fine, but in this game it doesn't.  The problem lies in dungeon navigation. If the graphics had been better, or if there had been better dungeon design, perhaps navigation wouldn't be so confusing.  It's really hard to tell where you are because the dungeon design is so bland and repetitive; there are usually no landmarks with which to navigate, with the result that I actually wound up back at the entrance thinking it was the exit. On another note, something else that bothered me was the fact that even by the end of the game, you couldn't really return to much of anywhere you had been previously.  I kept expecting be able to return to Parm eventually, but no such luck.

*NOTE: This part's an extremely important part--the game is glitchy.  It would freeze randomly, forcing me to reset and start over.  The cds themselves were in good condition with almost no scratches of any kind, and I've heard this same complaint before, which leads me to believe the glitches are a flaw of the game design.  This is a huge turnoff--this added in extra frustration to an already boring game. This flaw knocks points off the score.

Overall (4/10): Note this score is not an average, it's my subjective overall score.  I must say, given the flaws of this game, I'd never play it again. It's too bad really, it could've been a decent game if the makers had cut out the middle of the ""plot"" and fixed the glitches.  I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless they absolutely have played every other good RPG out there and are just dying for something else to play.

I can't really figure out when to ""lean"" vs. ""turn"" in the 4-man bobsled/2-woman bobsled/skeleton/luge (essentially the same thing, but I seem to be better at some than others, for some reason, presumably because you need to lean in some, where others you can just turn, as I've been doing).  Similarly the ski-jumping (both regular and big-hill) are pretty cool, but I find little guidance in how to land properly, other than not having crashed after the fact.

First off, it is the prettiest game I've ever played, by far. Combat and movement is smooth as silk; the characters' mannerisms are believable and the acting is spot-on, as usual.

My first gripe is all the damn cords.  I have them hooked up for my Xbox, PS3 and computer.  Its a mess of cables that go here and there and there is no way to reduce the amount of cables.  Most of the tangle is related to the Tritton and there is no way around it.

My mic stopped working about 4 months after getting the headset so I had to contact Tritton.  The customer support experience was awful.  Their hours are like Mon - Tuesday, 4AM-1PM and they are closed for lunch from 4:05AM until 12:58PM.  You would have a better chance of getting through to the President of the United States.  The hold times are unreal. When I finally got throught, things were better.  Tritton sent me a mic to replace the broken one free of charge - so that's a plus.  However, the mic they sent was NOT a matching replacement.  The Tetris-looking part on the new mic didn't ""fit"" into my headset.  I had to get a sharp knife and cut off a piece of plastic in order for it to fit.

I am a big Star Trek fan and I love Star Trek games. While there have been more stinkers than winners and I still hold out hope that SECRET OF VULCAN FURY will one day be brought back, I look forward to each release with excitement. I had very high hopes for Star Trek Online but after some play in the beta and now the release, I have since cancelled my membership and will no longer play this poorly designed game.

While I could overlook the weak graphics, the game play made me frustrated. The most annoying  thing was completing a hard mission and then never getting credit for it. When searching the forums, I find out that you had to be at a certain level to get credit for completion. Nowhere in the game is it said this is needed nor are you prevented for doing a mission you will never get credit for. To me, this is a showstopper. And when I finally get to the level that the forums say I need to be on to complete it, I still don't get the credit and by the 4th time on a mission, I never want to see it again. I had to be harsh but this takes the fun out of the game.

The game itself isn't half bad but it could be more ambitious. The space combat is excellent and the ground combat isn't too bad. However, there is hardly a moment of awe exploring something or even handling a diplomatic situation. I think I handled one situation on a planet but never again. Star Trek was WAY more than just battles. If they incorporated what made the old games 25th Anniversary and Judgment Rites so much fun, then this game would have been a winner.

Being that this is an online game and it can grow, I perhaps can return to the game if they fix the bugs or add more ""exploring"" or ""diplomatic"" missions.

I picked up the Razer Naga Hex thinking that it would be convenient to map the six extra buttons to functions in Visual Studio that I use all day for my work.  I quickly discovered that at least in the default settings, these buttons are programmed to emulate keyboard strokes on the corresponding number key.  For example, pressing button number [5] is equivalent to pressing [5] on my keyboard.  This is useless for Visual Studio since I ordinarily type numbers.

Reading the directions, it says that I must install Razer's ""Synapse"" software to program the buttons to do what I want.  Synapse is an always-online program advertised to share my custom settings between devices.  I had trouble registering for Synapse, and I object to being forced to be online with someone's online system to use a mouse; maybe I'm just old-fashioned, but I think that if I pay $80 for a mouse, I shouldn't have to fork over my e-mail and personal information to a third party to use it!

On the plus side, the mouse is very responsive and comfortable to grip, but I cannot endorse a mouse that requires an always-on internet connection to operate.  In Razer's defense, this requirement is printed on the box, but I didn't read it.  I really think that companies that demand that we hand over our personal information to use a product we purchased need to hear a strong message that we will not accept that.

82460,2.0,True,"05 25, 2008",A3W4NLU1LAA153,B000FPOJOS,Chris L,"Right up front, I'll point out the three most obvious things about GT5 Prologue.
1. It looks gorgeous
2. The AI is abominable.
3. There is still no car damage.

To use a lovely english expression : it's all mouth and no trousers. Look past the HD graphics and hype and you'll find Gran Turismo 1 lurking here.

The Gran Turismo games are known for their accurate car handling and fantastic graphics, and GT5 Prologue is no exception. The problem is that it is all absolutely ruined by the other driver AI. Previous Gran Turismo titles have never exactly shone when it comes to the AI, but in GT5 it's simply non-existent. It's not that the AI is dumb, it's just not there. The other cars all drive on rails, irrespective of where you are. For example, on the High Speed Ring circuit - there's a challenge to get from the back of the pack to the front in a single lap. In the car they give you, it is 100% impossible to come any higher than 3rd, and that's a stretch. The driving-on-rails is so accurate and predictable that you can actually predict exactly where every car will be at any given point. You'll come up behind the Ford Focus at the end of the second turn, and don't even think about passing him on the outside because he will always jink to the left for no reason as he goes across the bridge. If you're in the way, then tough. The game will just force you off the track. At the next corner, the Mazda 6 will always follow the identical line inside the corner, again irrespective of whether you're there.
The same is true in the other types of race. Within minutes of playing this game, you will find yourself making a tidy corner only to have a much faster car come right up behind you and ram you off the track because you're in the way of it's pre-programmed line. To see how truly awful it is, start a race at the back and watch the 15 cars in front of you. They'll all cut the same corner in the same way, every lap, all with the identical puff of dirt as they do it.
It is simply abominable.

The problem is that this issue was solved long ago by the likes of - well - just about every other racing franchise out there. It's compounded by the fact that there is still no car damage or dirt in GT5. You can stuff any car into a concrete armco at 175mph and it will simply bounce off without so much as a scratch. To think that Polyphony could put out a game with no car damage and ruinous AI on a next-gen console in 2008 just boggles the mind given how accomplished the competition is (think: Project Gotham Racing).

So what about the eye-candy aspect? Well - it runs at 1080p (full HD) and it looks absolutely spectacular. The textures are crisp and don't blur out at highly obtuse angles like they would on an X-Box. The car models are beautiful as are the various effects like the real-time reflections and the colour-flip paint jobs. There is some aliasing on high-contrast areas but detail popup is minimal. There are very noticable level-of-detail swaps on some of the cars where they swap from a low detail to a high detail version. It's most noticable on the Daytona circuit where you'll occasionally see the shading on the back of a car pop noticably as the model swaps to it's higher resolution version. In fact the eye-candy aspect is only marred slightly be the fact that the game clearly doesn't run at 60 frames per second. Well - it does on sparsely populated tracks but in the thick of the action on some circuits, you'll see noticable slowdown which you just shouldn't have on a console as powerful as a PS3.

What other things to know about? Well the online aspect of the game has a lot of promise but it's buggy at best. If your PS3 isn't set up pefectly on a broadband network (NAT type 1) it just won't connect to the servers. If you're lucky enough to have a good setup, then even when it does connect, the racing is a bit dodgy. It's obvious that the sample rate for your system communicating with all the others is fairly slow as you'll often see your opponents cars jump across the circuit from one side to the other, or suddenly appear to brake or accelerate at light speed as the servers catch up.

When you come to use the game for the first time, be prepared for a long wait. It seems to copy the entire blu-ray disc on to the internal hard drive which takes a good 15 minutes, then as soon as you connect, it will download a huge update which will take 5 to 10 minutes to download and another 5 minutes to install. So out-of-the-box to first race is about 30 minutes. That seems a bit odd to me - I was entirely expecting the game to run off the disc like many of the other PS3 titles.

So GT5 Prologue : it's great eye-candy, sure. But the two biggest, most long-standing problems with the GT franchise are still present. Awful AI and no car damage. The press previews and talk from Polyphony indicate that the full game will have car damage, but historically, they've never been known to change their underlying game engines between the 'Prologue' and the full versions of GT. They have always claimed that they've fixed the AI with each successive version of the game, but honestly - GT5 Prologue has taken a massive step backwards. They say it's better than ever but it's actually worse than ever. So when they say there will be car damage in the full game, I say 'cry wolf' I'm afraid.

It's an ominous omen for GT5 later this year. Sure it'll have more cars and more tracks. But chances are it will have the same problems the GT franchise has always had, and that's simply not good enough. Couple that with the questionable frame rate and online problems and that could be disastrous.

I dearly love the GT  franchise - I've had every one of them and I've been hoping and praying that they would one day fix the AI problems and the lack of car damage. If they've not done it on the PS3, then it's just never going to happen, and that is a sad indictment of Polyphony's marketing strategy.

Well i kept my Elite had the extra money so i decided to get this and try it out to see if i wanted to sell my Elite to my lil nephew who wants and Xbox. Plugged it in started downloading my online games, froze up around 90% on Trials HD. I proceeded to hit all the buttons on the controller(which had a lose piece of something making noise on the inside of it), went up hit the button to shut it down, nothing, so i unplugged it back in. Felt the system it was blazing(note:i have a totally open entertainment system with my HD TV, PS3, etc. not a thing closed in. Upon plugging the system back in the power pack was also extremely hot, then guess what? You guessed it, red light came on, and no power no nothing for the whole system. I'v seen some things about the system having the red light when you power up the system but it wouldnt even beep to turn on, NOTHING!. I work on computers for a living and am stunned that something straight out of the box could fry so quickly. My thought is that the brick itself isn't running enough power, or the +/- going  through the system power supply is blowing out, for what reason? I have no clue. The only other thing i know is with all the new system ventilation your more likely to get extreme Static Discharge on your unit, so definitely do not set it on any kind of plush carpet or touch it if you feel a slight bit of static shock on anything around it.  Thats really the only thing i can think of at the moment that could be the issue, i don't bother with tech support i just took it back and they gave me a full refund. They said usually they don't but they were actually expecting problems, so they are making exceptions. Good thing i didn't trade my Elite, i've had 0 problems with it from day one. Love xbox but i guess there are still touchy issues, which is expected with a new system. Also have a PS3 0 problems, so i think its just luck of the draw here.

UPDATE:I'd like to add that,  If your old enough to remember, nintendos(original) and ataris, they took so much beating and lasted forever. Also stereos, even older computers took a LOT more abuse and lasted a long long time as well. Technology is becoming a very advanced process, much different from the old days, more power, more speed, and a more vast array of visuals are just stunning the world now, so it stands to reason the new stuff has trouble. Also your packing the power of a large desktop computer into a small compact unit, so yes there will be heat, and other issues as well with so much in something so small. Just like laptops will never beat a desktop for gaming, same reason, size, and they have the same issues.

As you would expect, HORI's first or likely many case has padded compartments so that in route to your buddy's house for some Amiibo VS Amiibo excitement, the figurines do not take damage either from falls, or simply knocking into each other. In other words - expect in one months time a selection of competing items to solve your amiibo care needs, don't settle for this unless you don't care about their condition or will use some household workaround.

I love this item and think it's great for NON amiibo storage of say, Nintendo CD cases, 3DS accessories, wii motes, heck - even my old power glove might fit in it.

Why I didn't like it:
Although the game looks great, it plays just like every other major shooter I've experienced.

The single player campaign is short and just kind of uninspired.  You're supposed to be in charge of the unit for much of the game, but Irish is clearly the boss and you are powerless to make any decisions.

The environment is fairly static with the exception of the building that collapses in the first ""17 minutes"" of the game which was seemingly designed as a prolonged trailer for marketing purposes.

The multiplayer is a big disorganized mess and objectives offer no immediate rewards or consequences.  It's all a giant team deathmatch and with so many players in a match you are basically just one of the crowd unless you are one of the hardcore players who is fully dedicated to the game.  I know this experience is pretty much present in any online multiplayer but the map designs and player capacity of BF4 make the issue feel worse than ever.  It feels so much like the rat race that video games are supposed to offer us relief from.

Whether this game is better or worse than COD Ghosts I don't know or care.  The fact that the two are considered rivals makes me certain that I do not want to play COD at all.

I would've given this one star, but I found it to be more fun than Killzone Shadow Fall so I had to give it some credit.  I just wish that we as consumers could get the developers of these major shooter franchises to break the mold a little bit and change things up in the 5th, 6th, or 7th version of the games they made back in 2007/2008.

359644,2.0,False,"04 27, 2015",ACK92GHVVETOB,B00KOOUVNI,Red Panda,"Story:
(relatively spoiler free, but still read on at your own discretion)

Granted, the story started off with a lot of promise. I felt like they were building a wonderful plot, but it turned out a lot of the questions that arose in the first half of the story (like about Rain's mysterious purpose, or why there was such a ridiculous amount of focus on Mileena) ended up amounting to nothing. Even when they did a great job of developing a character, as was the case with Kotal Kahn, they managed to undo all of their progress with choppy and meaningless resolutions.

Too much of the story incorporated the Revenants without pushing the story forward. They were used as grunts to give Shinnok and Quan Chi an intimidation factor. Revenants are the people who were killed in MK9 and now serve the Netherrealm. They ranged from both villainous characters like Sindel, to heroic mainstays such as Liu Kang and Kitana. This was initially an intriguing plot point, even as far back as MK9 when it was first introduced. But in MKX, it was drawn out in such a way that you began to realize that it probably wouldn't be resolved at any point. In fact, the final scene at the end of the credits harked back to this, which, due to its sloppy execution throughout the story, made that final scene less impactful. Instead of having the same ""wow"" factor as the final scene from MK9, it was more like, ""Yes, we're following a formula.""

Shinnok, the primary villain, was poorly handled from the start. His time at the beginning of the campaign was short and only served to make him appear incredibly weak. Later, when he was brought back into the story, a lot of his motives went unexplained and seemed very ""pasted on"" last minute. ""I'm using handwavium to gain immense power and increase peril."" His actions are very ""left field."" Not to mention, he has to acquire power to change his form at the end of the game, but once again, it diminishes the fact that he is a GOD. He has escaped from his prison, and he is in possession of the amulet that gives him limitless power. That power, in Mortal Kombat 4 (which this game is essentially rewriting for better or worse,) was instantaneous. Many of the character endings after beating Shinnok in MK4 bounced off of the idea of ""What will this character do now that they have limitless power?"" Apparently, in MKX, Shinnok uses that limitless power to be a doofus who is easily defeated by Jean Claude VanDamme. And not to mention, his alternate form is extremely generic, and only serves to demean anything cool Netherrealm Studios could have done with his normal form.

And Shinnok's giant skeletal hands are just corny in this game. Netherrealm studios could have worked MIRACLES with this as both a story element, gameplay mechanic, fatalities, and graphic intensity, but they dropped the ball in almost every way. His skeleton-based attacks in the gameplay alone are downright laughably bad: He has one move where a large skeletal arm appears out of nowhere and FLICKS YOU. I kid you not.

Moving on...

Goro has no purpose in the game other than pathetic fanboys crying for him to be included, and a shameless grab for preorders. Goro and Ferra/Tor have no real part in the story except for a couple blurbs in their profile pages that explain who they are. Ferra/Tor's explanation isn't even nailed down - there are three speculations as to the who and why behind the character. This would have been very easy to write into the story.

The gameplay isn't innovative. It feels exactly like MK9. So when people say Far Cry 4 plays just like Far Cry 3, this isn't any different.

Regarding the ""three fighting styles"" for each character: Firstly, this is nothing new. Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance (5) and Deception (6) both had similar systems that I'd argue were far less limiting than being locked into one style for a whole match as it is in MKX.

I had to fire up MK9 to take a look at the roster, and I'm surprised that there were 27 characters, and 31 to 32 if you add in the DLC. The roster for MKX feels a lot smaller, despite having a base of 25. Maybe it's because some of the best characters are gone, and characters who aren't really even in the story have stuck around. The only characters who matter in the storyline are Scorpion, Quan Chi, Shinnok, Johnny Cage and his family, D'Vorah, Kotal Kahn, Raiden, and Sub-Zero. Everyone else is superfluous. I honestly feel cheated that my consolation prize is being able to play as THREE VARIATIONS OF KANO. No, I do not give a crap about Kano or half of this roster. Sigh. Netherrealm, please don't make the same mistake that your predecessor made for almost two decades: Don't keep characters around just because people in their forties remember them from their youth. We loved Sub-Zero and Scorpion, sure, but please let them die. Let Liu Kang retire - he won the first four MK games for crying out loud! Give him a break! Even when you try to ""retire"" a character, they still seem to end up in the lineup! (I'm looking at you, Jax.) You took away our cyborgs (all four of them) and gave us a bunch of children. You took away all of our favorite monsters (Baraka, Sheeva) but left us with Reptile? Sindel, Kabal, and Nightwolf are all in various stages of ""not being in the game,"" either, but geriatric versions of Liu Kang, Kung Lao, Johnny Cage, Jax, and Kenshi are still hanging around? Kotal Kahn appears interesting, but even after beating the game, I don't know his origin. I *think* he's not related to Shao Kahn, which is a nice change from everyone else being someone's kid. But sorry, feuding with Mileena doesn't give you any street cred. And your moveset is the worst in the game. *shudders*

Speaking of bad character choices, Jacqui Briggs exists because they wanted a strong, black, female character. Nothing says all of those things like making her an exact miniature version of her father, Jax. ""We'll model her after a man so much that we'll even give her his DNA - that'll show everyone we're in touch with female gamers. And with any luck, you'll be able to murder her, in-game, playing as her own father.""

Jacqui has no story worth telling in a Mortal Kombat game, (the same is true for Takeda and Kung Jin as well,) her fighting styles are generic, her gauntlets (seriously? You have daddy issues) don't offer anything new or interesting, and her style is incredibly weak - especially when you compare her to the game's standouts, like D'Vorah and Ferra/Tor.

Other characters are just as bad, if not worse. The new ""good"" characters in particular are all related to someone else, with poorly fleshed-out storylines, generic outfits, boring movesets (with a few exceptions) and this gets me, but even the X-Ray moves feel cheap this time around. Almost everyone ends their X-Ray with a knee to the jaw, and a lot of the X-Rays are even longer than they were in MK9, which doesn't impress me, but gives me time to step away from the game to text my friends back or check my facebook. It pulls me out of the game.

Fatalities are another mixed back. The detail is intense and they are stylistically a little different than they were in MK9. Some of the fatalities are very creative, where others can't even remotely compete with the fatalities in MK9. Scorpion, for example, is a huge let-down in creativity. But on the other hand, Ermac has at least one fatality that shows us that Netherrealm studios is, in fact, the only studio that should be handling this franchise. As far as the more generic fatalities go, I forgive NR Studios. There will always be more Mortal Kombat games, and we all have our favorite and least favorite fatalities in each. At least these fatalities are very polished - even the ones I don't care for look good.

Let's not forget Quan Chi having the best fatality in MK4 (ripping off your own leg and beating you to death with it) and the absolute worst of all time in MK5 (jumping onto your shoulders and stretching your neck two feet in the air.) It happens.

All-in-all, I feel like this game could have been more than just another fighting game. It could've taken the ball from MK9 and run with it, but it instead feels like an entirely different creative team worked on the story, which for me, is a very important part of a Mortal Kombat game, especially after the excellent handling of the story from MK9.

What I would have liked to see:

MK9 spanned three storylines by rebooting MK1, 2, and 3. So part of my expectations for this game revolved around that promise. Why not allow not one, but TWO ancient powers to rise at the same time, forcing Outworld and Earthrealm into chaos over the return of both the elder god, Shinnok (MK4,) and the Dragon King (MK6)? So much effort was put into establishing different factions, like a cast of Outworlders who, at times, were peaceable. Why not use two incredibly powerful villains to expand our base of ""good guys"" deeper into Outworld? While Cassie Cage is trying to keep her family from being murdered by Shinnok, other story missions could've had Ferra/Tor confronting what it means to be a monster when searching for a real monster in the dragon king. Or Erron Black questioning his alliance to Kotal Kahn upon the return of the true emporor, the dragon king. Not to mention, it would've been a lot of fun watching Shinnok confront the dragon king, even if there was no combat, just so we could learn how the dragon king compares to a god. And a newer, better story surrounding the dragon king's return would be nice.

Sigh. The gameplay is fine, overall, and I'll still have a little fun with the game as I unlock new fatalities and tower endings. But with a cast of characters that I largely don't want to play as, and a storyline that is completely forgettable (I replayed the MK9 story campaign for fun several times,) this title will probably fall to the back of my library within a few months.","I felt like they were building a wonderful plot, but...",1430092800,20,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I have played the first Onimusha game from start to finish. You can check my other reviews to see what I thought of that one. I was hoping that three sequels later they would have fixed the glaring flaws in what would otherwise exemplify some of the prettiest graphics for the PS2 console. They fixed only one of the problems from the first game.

First of all, my biggest complaint has got to be the play control, or the lack of it. Sure they fixed the ""Tank Controls"" so at least you don't have to rotate your character before making them walk forward. But it's still just a boring button masher. What fun is a game when you can practically close your eyes and just tap the X button repeatedly and win a great deal of the battles?

During the battles where a little more finesse and variation is required, I found the controls to be sticky and delayed to an annoying degree.  Also considering that this is a game where the hero has a few different swords he can play with, I was really annoyed that there was not quick way to switch back and forth. You have to press start and go through a menu system to select a different sword. What a stupid way to interface weapon selection in a combat game! If it had been an RPG, menus wouldn't matter as much, but in a hack n' slash? Come on guys try a little! I also have a personal beef that they choose not to add platforming. Seriously now, this is a game where we see the hero or other ancillary characters display superhuman feats of speed, strength and agility, and you mean to tell me they can't hop a three-foot break between two rooftops or hop up just one friggin' foot to reach a step-ladder that had the bottom blown off? It's just lazy game design!

So let's get to the story. It's based loosely on Japanese lore and myth about warring factions in feudal Japan, but enhanced with mysticism and armies of demons and zombies. It's also a highly convoluted story. It's also full of cheesy dialogue and campy voice-overs that you'd expect from most average anime features. I suppose that for many people, that might be reason enough to get the game, but it's not a preference for me. Take that for what it's worth, you very well might like it. There's also the token Onimusha trend of having people's diaries and random books of myth scattered about in the game to add detail to the world's setting and atmosphere. To me this is a cop-out to avoid cinematic storytelling. Then again, some of the journals really add nothing and only serve to further water down the game. I felt like I'd wasted time just picking them up and reading them.

I'll be 100% honest with you and openly state that I did not play this game from start to finish. I played it for about 4 hours and then took the disc out to return to my brother whom I borrowed it from. Other than pretty graphics, this game offers me nothing worth investing hours of my time into. I rarely get flat out bored playing a game and this game managed to do it.

Considering that my brother loves this game and he's an adult as well, I suppose that means that there are people out there that this game was made for.

Unfortunately, the low-resolution and sub-par framerate of this camera have left a bad taste in my mouth.

Video chats are not that impressive because of the low framerate of the camera. Instead of 30 frames per second, like most digital cameras, I think the Vision camera has a framerate of maybe 10-15 frames per second. And that's on a good day. If you and a friend are chatting and just sitting still, this will offer decent results. The second one of you start to move, the video becomes choppy and grainy almost instantly.

Speaking of grain, the resolution of the Vision camera rivals that of most entry-level cell phones. I understand that it would be extremely cost prohibitive to include a 5 megapixel camera, but taking a picture with this thing is just bad. Unless you have professional-grade lighting equipment in your house, you're not going to get anything that's worth keeping for too long.

Another thing that was promised with the use of the Vision camera, was gesture-based and live feed based gaming. The game that comes for free with the camera, Totem Ball, has been a continual source of frustration because the camera has a hard time picking up where you're standing and where your arms are at. To move your character around and ultimately play the game, you have to continually move your arms up and down. It would be one thing if this was just physically tiring, but the game is really not that good and the camera has a hard time distinguishing where you are or how far away you are if you're playing on a larger TV set. And the live feed based games just show a continual video feed of your usually semi-nude opponents during games like UNO and a few others. This doesn't offer that much to the gameplay except you now get to see who's calling you racial slurs or hurling homophobic remarks.

  The battle system is very simplistic at best which is ok.  You have to extract elements from objects to make potions and other things to battle with.  They give you two battle options.  These are to attack or defend.  The battle system is old school turn based.

  The art style and backgrounds are reminicent of Secret of Mana (totally unrelated SNES game).

  Where this game falls really short is the fact that your character is two dimentional  This is not a bad thing by itself but it tries to be three dimentional.  The game randomly pops up elements and items.  You can actually exit a building and extract all items then enter the building, re-exit and extract the items again.  You can build up an infinite supply of elements like this.  The problem is, the way the environment is set up it is hard to see where you are going.  Often times, there are areas that you can jump to that you can't see because the scenery is in your way.  This gets annoying very fast.  The character doesn't interact with the environment very well.  I got stuck in a wall, jammed up on top of a ladder, and just couldn't find the right place to jump to get where I was going several times.  I think if you could rotate your view there would be no problem.  I still am not sure why items keep popping in locations that you can't get to.

  The fact that the main character likes to yell out ""Barrel"" everytime he checks a barrel is also very annoying.

  I recommend staying away from this game.  I haven't seen a good game with the word mana in it for a long time now.  I would like Nippon Ichi entertainment to try again.  I think the potential is there, they just need to try something different than what they have made here.",Eternal annoyance,1124755200,12,,

My initial reaction was ""Wow, Sega actually took this game really seriously."" The first couple levels as Sonic backed up this prediction, as the gameplay was the smoothest I'd seen it in any 3D Sonic game;  It played like Sonic Adventure 2, but faster.  However, I got to the first Werehog level, and all my hopes for this game were mocked.

First of all, this is really a very good HOG - it's a very long game with many locations to explore.  The objects are (mostly) difficult but not impossible to find, and each room has a few items that have crossword-like clues (rather than names) that require a bit of thought.  The game is timed, but there is no penalty if you run out of time.  Moreover, as you collect ankhs along the way, you unlock additional games - Luxor Classic, Luxor Match-3 and Endless Search and Find, so you're really getting four games for the price of one.

A few objects are a bit *too* well-hidden (I couldn't see them even when I resorted to the hints), and some are hard to click - I'd resort to the hints, only to see that I'd found the object but hadn't clicked on the right part of it.  It doesn't help that the cursor is a big, clunky bejewelled thing and you can't opt out of it.  Most of the mid-level mini-puzzles are ridiculously easy, and I wasn't crazy about the storyline - it's a bit too mystic-weird for my tastes.

It's the marble-shooter that ruined the game for me.  Every level ends with Luxor Classic, and you have to win before you can go to the next level - there is no way to skip past it.  I have no hand-eye coordination and simply could not beat this thing.

I decided to give GW2 a shot because it looked different than those other games and I had hoped it would be a breath of fresh air. I am a very casual gamer that doesn't raid, or care about having all the best gear. I just enjoy questing, some dungeons, crafting and pvp here and there. This looked like the kind of game for me. Well, after playing for a month, I am disappointed. Maybe my expectations were too high but the game just didn't appeal to me like I thought it would.

First off, the graphics look great, no doubt about that. The characters, mobs, environment all look better than any other MMO that I have played. The thing is, it takes more than good looks to make a game fun. The character creation is fun and varied but for whatever reason, I don't like the look of some of the characters. The Asura and Sylvari just don't look good to me. Compared to the other races, they just look kind of ""silly"". I tried to make and play them and it just didn't work for me. That just left 3 races, two of which (Norn and Human) look too similar.

I have to say, I miss the quest hub style of play. I understand that you are supposed to go out and explore the world and find things to do, I get that. The problem is, I really don't find that much to do. The quests are far and few between and are not any more exciting than the go here, kill this, gather X number of these,that the other games on the market have. It's kind of cool to stumble into one of the dynamic events that occur in the zones, but after doing it the first time, it becomes tedious. The ""dynamic"" event always goes on at the same place and it's the same thing. It's kind of hard to feel like you are changing the world when these events keep happening. The whole idea of having vista's is somewhat lost on me. Go to an area, find the way to get on top of the mountain, building etc, but why? What is the purpose other than get a birds eye cinematic of the area. It just seems like pointless busy work to me.

I really enjoy crafting and while the crafting system here might be good, I find it hard to get very far in it. I like the idea of experimenting to learn new things as opposed to just training every few crafting levels. The problem I have is getting the materials to do the crafting. As I level I harvest, mine, and salvage anything that I can, but it's still not enough materials to advance the skills. There just don't seem to be enough nodes or drops out in the world. This leads to the next thing I don't care for-

Scaling down levels. I understand why this happens, and many people might like it, I don't. ArenaNet wants you to be able to go back into an old zone and be on the same level as the person you are helping. They don't want you going back as a much higher level and one shot everything. I understand this. The problem I have with this leads back to my crafting complaint. Like I said before, I enjoy crafting as much as anything. I like to level it as I go. In many MMO's, this one included, you out level the zone before you get enough materials to level up your craft. This wasn't a problem in other MMO's. You could go back to the zone that has what you need (ores, herbs, cloth etc) and be able to get your mats without too much fuss because your level was higher than than the mobs in the zone. You could mine, gather, or kill some mobs quickly to get that cloth you need. The scaling down of your level now makes it that much harder. Here you have leveled your character, learned new spells only to feel week as a kitten again when you go back to the lower zone. So you spend hours killing mobs that should be lower than you just to get your items you need. Sure, this makes the game longer and gives you more to do. The problem is that even though you could be a 20+ level character in a level 5 zone, your armor still takes damage which can be very expensive to repair, which leads to the next issue, lack of income.

Maybe I am doing something wrong but getting money in this game is a chore and a half. It takes forever to earn a decent amount of coin. In this game, 1 silver is a good amount of money. It's not easy to buy things you need when you don't have the coin to do so. Again, maybe I am missing something here but it just seems a little out of whack.

Lack of mounts is another issue I have with the game. Having to run back to an area you just came from can take  quite a bit of time, time that could be better spent doing something else. At least having a mount would speed up the process. There doesn't need to be flying mounts but any kind of ground mount would be great. One nice thing is the waypoints. You can click on one that you have visited anywhere, anytime. While that is a nice feature, the problem is they cost money. In a game where money is hard to come by, spending them on waypoints will help keep you in the poor house for even longer. So, you have to weigh time vs money. Pay the fee to go to x on the map, or waste quite a bid of time running there. At least a mount would be a one time investment that would increase your travel time.

I don't really have any complaints with the skill system, pvp or dungeons. While nothing is spectacular, its decent. I haven't done much pvp but the little I did was fun. I do like how weapons affect your skills. It's nice to work with different combos to see what works best. It's a little confusing at first but nothing you don't learn from playing.

I know that many of the issues I pointed out are no big deal to a large amount of players, they are to me. Games should be fun and I just don't find this game to be that much fun. I finally logged back into the game yesterday after a two week break from it. I figured maybe I was just burnt out on the MMO in general. Well, it's not MMO burnout, it's just a dislike of GW2. It feels like ArenaNet has filled this game with ""fluff"" to make it a longer play experience. Vistas, having to explore to find quests, longer travel time, scaling down levels doesn't make it more fun, just more tedious. When I don't even want to log in and play, it's time to admit it wasn't for me.

Maybe something will change with the game that will make me want to come back. Maybe something will change with me that will make me want to play it again.

I favor hard sims, I'd rather be on iRacing competing against real drivers than playing an arcade game like Need for Speed. So I should be right up this game's alley... and I'm not. This game is laughable.

The install. WOW. Getting this game today is a nightmare. My console was setup with a wireless connection and the initial download took- I kid you not- 10 HOURS! My Xbox 360 on the same shelf can download a game in a couple hours, tops. Luckily I work from home so I just let it run then plugged in a wired connection because I knew the game needed more updates- the extra updates took AT LEAST 2 MORE HOURS! THIS GAME TOOK 12 HOURS TO INSTALL! I can't even fathom how you could engineer this so poorly. It's really astonishing. Multiple people online have complained about this, so it's not just me.

Graphics. A lot of people claim it's ""unfair"" to talk about the graphics because a new Forza came out on the next generation consoles while this game was still fresh. That doesn't matter, because to me GT6 looks like a PS2 game. There are odd graphical problems like texture ""baking"" where bad aliasing causes lines and objects in the distance to shimmer like you're seeing them in a desert heat. This is something that should have been relegated to the PS2 era, it's distracting and silly for a PS3 game.

Too much focus on the wrong thing. For instance mans try to defend the game talking about how there are so many more cars in GT6 than Forza, but most of the cars in GT6 are carbon copies of other cars, and lower in detail. There are 2 tiers of cars- basically new ones, and cars ported from PS2. Most of the cars in the game are ported from PS2 and don't have proper interior views as well as being of generally lower visual quality. Many of these games are also either 100% copies or vastly similar to other cars, such as their being screens full of Mazda Miatas or Nissan Skylines- even serious collectors don't need this many copies of cars when many of these cars were absolutely the same during several model years so there was no need to make a new version for each year. This is sort of a theme throughout the game- lots of ""stuff"", but a lot of it is not well thought out. Personally, I hate the Lunar Rover missions. There's a lot of puzzling ideas in here as well, like the path of the rover is littered with obvious ""outcrops"" of rocks, which are clearly props put in by the devs randomly which don't look anything like the actual surface of the Moon. The prop rocks flip you rover over, which is easy to do in zero gravity, so you have to wait for the rover to right itself which is both slow and takes you out of the mission. So you have an event, you can play it, but it's pretty terrible. Having 10,000 kinds of rice crackers will never add up to a steak dinner- I wish that effort had been placed on things like including more detail on the cars.

Terrible audio. Fans have spent many words trying to defend the sound in GT6, but it really does sound mostly like they recorded one home vacuum cleaner and digitally modified the sound three or four times then called that selection sufficient to represent hundreds of cars. It's absolutely unacceptable, and sounds pretty similar to PS1 and PS2 games. It's hilariously bad compared to the equivalent Forza. Add-ons like turbos are often laughably bad.

Lots of design decisions are objectively bad, and dated. A great example is that GT6 continues to have a menu system where for every single one of the hundreds or thousands of events you'll participate in, you do your race then you get a menu screen where you have to scroll all the way to the right to select the ""exit"" option to go to your next event. Only in a multi-race championship will the default option be ""continue"". This is simple user design straight out of the 1990s. Every single motion or click your user has to do to move on to what they want, you lose engagement. If you want to prevent a user accidentally exiting a race, put the Next/Exit button one step away from the Replay button. Don't hide it on the far side of the screen where you have to scroll over just to even see it. I also really hate most of the event screens- you get a laughably bad backdrop that looks like a background on a Windows '95 computer with simple text on top of it. Sometimes there will be jarring issues with this text, like the backdrop will be a nature scene yet the text has a reflection on the bottom like it's being placed on a shiny surface. When did the grass and brick walls get the same uniform reflection? It's dumb, and bad.

So the game is a mess. The actual car simulations are pretty good, but for ever positive (cars move under braking very realistically) there's a corresponding negative (tires overheat and cool off way too fast- some builds of cars will be impossible just because the weird tire model causes problems). If you're really jonesing for a new sim like I was, it's still GT at its core, so it's an okay drive. But it's definitely a bargain bin title.

263982,2.0,False,"02 6, 2014",A2LPJD19MGBNXJ,B006MBZZSI,Adrian Jenkins,"I have to confess that the original Hyperdimension Neptunia caught me by surprise. While the game was pretty bare bones and low budget, the writers and developers had a good plan laid out. Why not gently tweak the game industry itself, rather than put out another bland, turgid JRPG with the same cliches that have been omnipresent for the last 25 years? HDN didn't always work, but there was enough about it to enjoy for the 50 or so hours that JRPGS now command. It was often humorous to meet characters from other franchises (and even systems) and see how they interacted with the personified versions of the main game systems. Often, it failed to be as funny as it thought it was (a common problem with ""Japanese Happy Fun Time!"" video games), but it did enough to justify a playthrough. So, what a shame it is that Hyperdimension Neptunia: Mk 2 fails so miserably to capture that spirit, making Hyperdimension Neptunia yet another in a long line of Pyrrhic victories for the JRPG this generation.

Is Mk. 2 better? I guess that depends on your definition. The graphics are better. The dungeons are more varied. Battle is more involved. There's more paedophilic references. If that's your cup of tea, you're in the right place. Unfortunately, for me, the game removed the one thing that made the original Neptunia enjoyable: the tweaking of the industry.

Supposedly, whereas the first Neptunia was about the console wars, this is meant to satire the handheld wars. I know this...because I read another review on Amazon. Honestly, I would have never guessed this if I wasn't told Yes, the main character has the name ""Nepgear"", which apparently harkens back to the (horrible) Game Gear of years ago. And yes, the world of Microsoft (Leanbox) doesn't have a junior girl, because MS doesn't have a handheld system. That's the joke. Nothing else really makes any sense after that. Lowee (the Nintendo world) has two very young girls personifying their handheld. Are there 2 because Nintendo has released both the Gameboy and the DS? But - why are they twins? Shouldn't they be older than any of the other junior personifications? And given the wild success of Nintendo over Sony and Sega, shouldn't they be a LOT more powerful?

The fact is, little thought was put into any sort of satire of the industry, because apparently, this game decided that the characters were more important than, well, the entire purpose of the original game. What a shame. The only things they keep are the personifications themselves and the patently unfunny names of the planets (Leanbox? Lastation? That's not terribly funny).

And honestly, once you fail to be impressed with the premise, the small improvements do nothing to soften the blow. While this game is more sophisticated than its predecessor, that's akin to saying that the original calculator is more sophisticated than the abacus. The game is still light years behind any of its contemporaries, and you probably have to go back 3 generations before you find battle systems more primitive than the ones in this game.

So, lousy premise, archaic battle system, colorful but extremely-dated graphics...hmmm, what redeems this? Not much. There are multiple endings, but it's hard to care about them. One ending is so out of place that it makes me wonder what the developers were thinking. The game is rated M, and the rating is well-deserved. Outright (and tasteless) paedophilia is on display at times. Battle is easy, but a slog. The ""improvements"" actually do more to hamper playability. Outside of hunting for endings, the postgame is pretty much grinding for trophies (including the grammatically-incorrect ""Freshly Grinded Girls"", which forces you to get your characters to level 99, despite the fact that you can do pretty much everything in the game at around level 65, if memory serves), and battling in an arena against monsters that apparently didn't make the cut in the game.

Pros:
- Strong RPG elements. You get to choose the styles of an agent you want to be.
Story and Script is interesting. Skills and missions are plenty.

Con:
- I don't know about the console versions, but the PC version has this particular issue that made me uninstall this game.

EVERY TIME the game loads a new area or a new information (like an incoming radio contact or a new objective), the camera jerks out of control.

It will fly to your back, over your head, aim right at the floor, any direction BUT the way you want it to be. That means when you go into an area with an enemy nearby, chances are you'll mess up.

I'm no stranger to stealth games, action or action-RPG. Never before that I messed up this much. I walked out of cover and got shot. I shot the floor instead of a guard and called in the rest of them. And I even meleed in the wrong direction !?!? All because of this camera issue !!!

I tried it with both joypad and mouse, the problem persisted...
I lowered all the video settings to minimum, the problem still persisted...
I played Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands on the highest video settings without even a hiccup. So I'm sure it's not my machine.

This is not just annoying. It's UNFORGIVABLE.

- Minor flaws for a joypad user. They tie the camera sensitivity to the aiming sensitivity. If you lower the sensivity so you can align your aim better with an analog stick, the camera turning speed will get dragged down to a crawl.
But if your camera turns with a moderate speed, it will be VERY difficult to align your shot to a small target.

In conclusion:
The game has a lot of potentials. But the developer ruined it all with LOUSY camera controls. If you can endure the frustration, this might not be a bad game for you.","Good RPG, BUT with a MAJOR turn-off",1285977600,5,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

Once I started the game however I was sorely disappointed to find out the game only allows your character to move around via the ""Stylus"" and the d-pad works like the button pad.  I am all for implementing the use of the Stylus in DS games, but it should be an option...not a requirement.

Everything in this game just seems to take forever.  Moving with the stylus and only being to activate your tools with the buttons is just a pain. The character tires out quickly and is constantly having to forage for food.  The whole thing is just awkward to me and I lose interest in the game very quickly.  I played Zelda's Phantom Hourglass with the Stylus method of moving around, but in that game it just worked better.

IMO the biggest challenge about this game is using the controls while the game itself isn't very challenging.  A lot of features seem stripped out of the game and it's just kinda boring.  It doesn't even measure up to HM DS Cute.  I am sure some people will enjoy this game and possibly will not be bothered by the Stylus interface, but Natsume missed the mark for me.

The biggest selling point of the game was that it carried forward over 1,500 songs from the previous games. For this to not be working after being publicized so heavily makes the game look bad.

Next, some of the new features are just not good and actually ruin immersion. The new guitar solo mode, for example, replaces the masterful solos pulled off by incredible artists like Hendrix, Joe Perry, Eddie Van Halen, and Tom Morello and instead want you to make up your own solo on the fly. It takes you out of the song. And what's worse is that turning that feature off doesn't always seem to save in the settings, so you have to check each time you start to make sure it didn't re-enable itself.

Lastly, some returning features have been dumbed down. The character creation has a laughably small amount of options and scrolling through your song list is a joke now because you can no longer skip from letter to letter with the artists names like before.

I feel like the game would have been helped greatly if it spent a little longer in development being play tested by people who don't work for Harmonix (who this comment section shows are very biased and unethical) and the DLC should have been completely buttoned down before release.

The problem is that the content of the discs is no different. There is no Windows launcher or installation - it is still only the DOS version on these discs. I ended up selling it because I didn't need 2 copies of the same thing. If this were a version that actually was upgraded to run on Windows I'd gladly buy it and be happy - but it's not. Be careful.

I have now switched the up gear shifting to a button, which is a little awkward to reach while trying to shift quickly. The wheel was not compatible with Need for Speed: Shift that I also ordered.  Even after adjusting the steering sensitivity to 100%, the best the Shift game would do was to have the car zig/zag slowly on the track--get GTR Evolution. I tried to treat the wheel gently, within reason, and the shifter still broke. Thrustmaster says it has a two year warranty. I haven't sent it back yet to check out the coverage.

The graphics are good enough from a distance but look cheap and thrown together at closer distances. It's obvious the Unreal engine needs to be put to rest once and for all. Havoc adds a little level of fun but what good is it really when the enemies vanish practically before they hit the ground? Weapon and player character animations are smoothly done but nothing really awe inspiring.

Although the first ""song"" you hear is quasi entertaining, it gets old fast after looping for an hour over and over. The worse offense in the sound department has to be the enemy ""barks"" The programmers gave enemies about three phrases for the entire game and it is etirely common to hear ten enemies say the same exact quote as you kill them in succession. "" Doe Rae Me Fa So long sucka!"" is corny the first time you hear it and just as bad the millionth (per level)In essence it feels like you're gunning down the same zig zagging target over and over. Ambient noises, weapons and voice acting pull the experience together. The weapons genuinly sound lethal and vehicles do sound powerful.

One of the games selling points is the AI. Every interview from creators claim that the AI is among the best on the market. It's more like the most dissapointingly mediocre. Enemies ignore walls in front of their faces and fire missiles trying to kill you. They also don't co-ordinate like in other games. Between mediocre enemy AI and poorly designed levels, I found myself accomplishing half of the game and wishing at some point it would start becoming enjoyable.

Finally, I've read a lot of bravado about how Hollywood screen writers are collaborating to create a compelling story for Pariah. Ok...where's the evidence? half way through the game you know as much as you did just reading the back of the box. Cutscenes don't really tell you what's going on and most of your objectives are to find Karina.

In all, Pariah leaves a bad after taste and the sense of being scammed for $50 that could have better been invested in another game. If this was a game three years in the making, the Pariah team must have spent two of those years fooling around.

For years I've been waiting for a good Gundam game, so it was with great excitement that I launched into this game.  What Bandai delivered is a game that has great visuals and a wonderful cast of characters from past and present Gundam series, but a fighting game that is lukewarm at best, absolutely horrendous at worst.
Badly balanced characters is the worst aspect of this game.  I've finished the game with every character by now, but every time I have to fight ""Psycho Gundam MkII"", it's still one of the most unpleasantly ill-balanced fights I've ever come across.  I know some gamers equate difficulty with fun and unfairness with challenge, but fighting a computer character whose every hit takes off about eight times more energy than you do isn't exactly my idea of fun (and I'm not talking about a Psycho Crusher-style, one-time-only super move either).  Even among the usable characters, Zeong (possibly my favourite Gundam character ever) and Quin Mantha are quite weak, but The-O is lopsidedly powerful.
There aren't that many playing options, either -- the Vs. mode doesn't offer that many more characters to choose from; the Story mode has laughable, generic Japanese anime cliche dialogue (""I'm as tough as they come"", ""I'll destroy you"", etc.), and the ending is so flimsy I would've rather not had any ending at all.
Being a huge Gundam fan, I still give this game an extra star.  Based on gameplay alone, this is a real stinker.  The only point of recommendation is really for the characters.

In order to obtain gear and improve your character you can run strikes, run the raid, run PVP, or do the challenge.  Everything else won't give you any improved gear to get better.  The raid is like the old Nintendo games, where you have to jump platform to platform without a single miss over and over and over to pass the level.  Or, if you miss one shot, it is time to start over...
This is similar to the raid.  You will do numerous, boring and repetitive, actions within the raid where one mistake leads to starting over.  Additionally, there is no system to find other players within the game.  It takes an hour to find a group to play the raid and an AVERAGE of two hours to finish the raid.  Then, you will only get loot to improve your player around one out of every three runs to completion.  You will, however, get the same piece of gear you already have four times, or so, before you get something new.
The strikes are fun and the most enjoying part of the game.  Although it is difficult to find a group for the hardest strike.  And, once again, expect a piece of gear that you actually need to drop about 10% of the time.  Really low loot drop rates.
The PVP is the worst PVP I have EVER PLAYED.  Don't even waste one second on this garbage PVP.  You will shoot an enemy with 45 bullets and they won't die.  They will shoot you with one bullet and you will die.  The enemy will use their super charge and kill your entire team.  Your super charge, the same one, won't even kill one enemy.  I am a very experienced PVP player with thousands of hours in COD and Battlefield games.  This PVP is horrible.  I won't play it on this game, EVER, for no reason, for no loot.  It is not worth the bad game play to ever set foot in the PVP of this game.  They have better loot drops and gear rewards in PVP but it is not worth the terrible game play to get it.  I choose to not have the loot at all, its not worth it.  Worst PVP ever created in a video game.  It feels like Bungie has never made a PVP game before in their existence.  Really?  From Bungie?  The Halo people?  They regressed horrible with this PVP and made a true nightmare of poor gameplay and frustration in this terrible PVP.
The challenge is fun, but once again, you have to find players to play with you as the game has no system to find them for you.  It takes time.  Then it will drop rewards of the same gear over and over again.  However, still really fun to defeat waves of enemies and destroy a boss with your friends.
If you want all the loot to improve your player you have to play all areas of the game.  Some parts of the game are so bad that I skip them and will never get the loot.

83838,2.0,False,"03 12, 2010",A2VVZAZO7924QI,B000FQ2DTA,Gooo_Gooo79,"Final Fantasy has always been RPG Adventure from its birth on the Nintendo and Final Fantasy Fans deserve the best Square (now) Square Enix can offer.  Yes we all know past games of the series have had dislikes but this new installment is an Adventure of Disappointments.  Now I am not saying this game needs to go into file 13 (the trash) but I would say rent this game first or wait till the price is more worth its true value.

  The adventure starts in the floating city of Cocoon.  Humans are protected by a mysterious race called the fal'Cie.  Once Cocoon's government targets humans from Pulse (after actions of a rogue fal'Cie) the world underneath Cocoon, a mission to resuce a friend begins.  Now lets talk about the characters!  Well we have six primary characters.  Overall I would say these characters are my least favorite of the Final Fantasy Series passing by Final Fantasy 9's heroes on my list.  First we have Lightning that gives of bad feelings with overtones of menace.  Hope is an orphan and I would have to say very whiny!  Snow thinks he is a stud and Vanille is not only spacey but runs at the mouth a lot.  Now Sazh seems to be a big fan of Chris Tucker in the way he acts and he appears to have the most level head out of everyone in your group.  Last but not least is Fang (female) who gives off some exotic appeal.  So in my opinion Sazh and Fang are the most colorful characters that keeps the whole group from being a total irritation.

  For the first 23-25 hours! (not an exaggeration) your characters are put into groups of two/three and go about exploring Pulse.  The story is strictly LINEAR!  That means no towns to vist and no interesting side characters.  Here is what you do:  walk, fight, walk so more, fight some more, check out some noninteractive cut scene, fight again and then save your game.  Now don't get me wrong because FF 13 does have some bright spots and it is time to mention some.  EYECANDY!  If anything can be said about Final Fantasy it is that the graphics seem to always get better.  I guess this is why it takes them so long to bring out the next game in the series every year.  The landscapes are breathtaking and the character animation is vividly lifelike!  You can say in the graphics that Final Fantasy XIII is poetry in motion!  I am also glad to see the vast assortment of human villains and monsters to fight.  NOW! If you can hold out through about 2/3 of the game the action will start to flow out beyond the straight-ahead path and you will see how characters' stories coalesce.

  Battles leave you in control of one character and the computer plays as the others.  However, you can still give some help to the other characters and change their specialties when needed so you can survive battles!  Over all I would have to say the battles are more at a faster pace which is why you are mainly taking care of one character during battles.  I always enjoyed having total control of my characters during battles but I can see some pros in this new battle system because it still demands various levels of strategy.

  All in all, Final Fantasy needed to make a big impression on gamers for the current generation of high-definition consoles.  Final Fantasy did on the graphics and did so-so to alright on the battle system but it failed on adventure.  I don't want to be mean to ""Lightning"" but I would have been happier with Cloud or Auron-like characters taking her spot.  I believe the loyal fans of Final Fantasy will endure through this title and take the good points of this game as you would food from a vast buffet.  New players to Final Fantasy might final this game dull and would lose patience in this game to the point that they would not find any good points in this title.

I know, there's hundreds of hours to the game, but I thought I'd share some initial thoughts and write a review I wish I'd read before purchasing it.

STORY

I got the game primarily because I loved KOTOR's story. Unfortunately, after playing SWTOR for hours, I still don't see any signs of a compelling story. Where KOTOR immediately threw you into a compelling story (flee the Endar Spire, save Bastila!), in SWTOR five hours on you're still going around the Jedi Temple grounds killing local monsters with no sense of the wider story.

This is really problematic because there aren't any compelling characters to accompany you on your quest in the beginning. Within 5 hours of KOTOR, you had already met Carth Onasi, Mission Vao, and Big Z (and Bastila and Canderous Ordo, depending on how long you took). By contrast, I just found the droid T-7. This makes the game feel extremely lonely as there are no characters by my side and therefore little dialogue.

I'm sure as the game progresses there will be more characters and a richer story. But I feel like I'm playing the game more out of duty and in the hope that it gets better rather than because I can't wait to find out how the story unfolds.

GAMEPLAY

The lack of a story would matter somewhat less if the gameplay were more exciting. Again, most of the missions are just going around killing enemies. There's little of the sort of interactive, story-based missions that made KOTOR feel like such an open world. The only one I've encountered so far, the forbidden romance between the two Jedi, was pretty short and almost perfunctory. Maybe the story will get deeper, but as a mission it seems like an aside rather than a mission quest that develops the character.

The control interface isn't bad. The attacks are all arrayed on a display at the bottom and other displays allow you to see your inventory and map live during gameplay. However, SWTOR doesn't have an in-game tutorial which means the learning curve is a bit steeper.

I have no interest in most of the MMO features and don't play games to make friends online, so I can't comment on how those work.

GRAPHICS

So far, from what I've seen the graphics are almost worse than KOTOR's! Yes, the characters are more rounded and have more polygons. Yes, the textures are probably better. But the art direction is just a horrible fit for Star Wars. The worlds come across as shallow corridors rather than wondrous environments. You don't get the sense of stepping into a real world, like you do on Taris or Dantooine in KOTOR. The lighting in SWTOR is a bit overwhelming and too bright, not really reflecting the subtleties of sunlight. Also, the grass doesn't seem to move when you walk, unlike the fields in KOTOR's Dantooine.

The characters are even worse. They look goofy. The hair almost never looks quite right. It looks like everybody is wearing a toupee. My character has an odd way of running, lifting his legs up and slightly outwards, almost as if he has a wedgie (by contrast, KOTOR's characters were great to look at from behind when running). Some of the more important non-playable characters look alright, such as the Jedi Masters on the Council, but overall I just can't take most of the characters seriously because of the art.

SOUND

While many have commended the voice acting, I've found it a bit lackluster. Admittedly, that's probably more due to the lackluster characters than the acting ability itself. Nonetheless, I have yet to hear a really memorable voice that really defines a character. No gruff Canderous, no bossy Bastila - basically, everybody I've met has the same old flat voice.

Sadly, the game has overall been a disappointment. It seems Bioware was more interested in making an MMO than making a worthy successor to KOTOR. What made KOTOR work was the combination of memorable characters and exciting story. I couldn't wait to keep play. By contrast, SWTOR so far lacks both. I know, I know, it's a big game, I've only played the Jedi class, and it will grow. Still, it's the game's job to get me excited, not my job to defend the game. I'll keep playing and give it a chance, but more out of obligation and the hope that it will get better than because I'm genuinely excited.

I'll revise my review once I play more.

UPDATE (02/27/2012):

I'm at level 18 now and the game is starting to pick up. Still not a really compelling story, but at least there are Sith and a broader plot. Also, it seems like there's more going on now than simply hacking away at human enemies. I'd revise my initial review to 2.5 stars, but most of what I wrote still stands.

UPDATE (03/10/2012):

I'm at level 22 now but I just got frustrated with the game and decided to cancel my subscription. After all that time playing, I still feel like the game didn't have enough story. I just got sick of going around killing nameless villains for no real payoff. While I could see the story starting to take shape, it was pretty boring and didn't seem particularly well thought out.

HERE'S MY OLD REVIEW:

I've only played it for a couple of hours, but here's my review so far:

The installation was a bit confusing (a bit different than other installers I've seen) but I got through it in about 10 minutes.  It had to update the Windows .NET framework and the C++ Redistributable, and since I had both on my machine (I'm a software engineer for a living) it got a little confused.  Not a big problem, just had to say OK to errors, then it ran fine.

The graphics --  I was stunned.  They are insanely realistic.  I kept saying ""Holy !@#$"" out loud, because the graphics are just so amazing.  It is obviously optimized, because it set all of my machine settings to the very highest.  When you are given the ride in the Jeep, you see things like shadows from trees jumping across the driver's shirt, and it just left me speechless from amazement.

The sound -- also quite incredible (I'm running a Bgears b-Enspirer 7.1).  Perhaps most noteable, was hearing the breeze flow through the grass and the trees... it sounds amazingly realistic (much more so that Crysis 2).

Game play -- well, I'll come back and fill this in, but so far it was interesting.  I've mostly just walked around and not doing objectives, because I wanted to check out the graphics.  But, for example, the screen is almost always free of any text or icons.  It's usually always only the environment around you.  The first objective was to ""get a car"".  You have to walk up to this ugly yellow car, open the hood, fix it, close the hood, then get it the car.  You may have to spend about 10 seconds adjusting it when it breaks.

Again, the graphics are just incredible.  After I fixed my first car, I drove it over a bridge, stopped halfway and got out of the car to look at the river below... and it's just absolutely breath-taking.

Anyway more later.  Again, don't worry about the .NET/C++ install it does, it's just part of the operating system you need and may not have.",Very nice,1224720000,6,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

**UPDATED** 08/22/15 -  I'm going to do a small update since I finally got to use this the way I had intended to.  First, I have had the DSi and the 3DS, and never had any problems logging into a hotel's wifi.  The hotel requires you to open a browser and just agree to the terms.  Simple on the DSi and 3DS.  Create a new connection, wait for the test to fail, open browser window and agree to terms.  BAM... online.  The ""New Nintendo 3DS XL"" is different.  I tried for hours to do the same thing and NOTHING.  It will not connect like the others did.  What is the point of having a handheld ""mobile"" gaming machine if it can not connect to a hotel's wifi?  My PS Vita is the same way.  I thought for sure that I would have no problems with the NEW 3DS because, the other 2 DS's I owned never had a problem and it's why I bought it.  I could also get those 2 connected even though my PS Vita would not, so the DSi and the 3DS became my mobile gaming machine.  The New 3DS XL, ruins that now.

As soon as EA signs an exclusive license deal with the NFL, they get lazy in their product.  Sure, the new quarterback feature adds another level of realism, but it was poorly implemented and needs a lot of work to bring it to where it should be.

Pros:

- The new quarterbacking system (thankfully it can be turned off) is a pretty cool idea.  Gone are the days when you can simply drop your quarterback 10+ yards behind the line of scrimmage and heave bombs to receivers you can't even see.  Defenders will now read your line of sight, allowing you to 'look off' a defender, or throw easy interceptions because you telegraphed your pass by not looking to other receivers.  I think this will be really cool when some of the bugs are worked out.  It's just clunky and you have far too many controller operations to pull off in a short amount of time.  Expect to be sacked 5 fold until you get comfortable with it.

- The Superstar mode.  The ability to create a player, follow and shape his career.  Hire and fire your agent , determine your player's genetic makeup, score a part in a movie.

- That's it...that's all that new in this freakin' game.

Cons:

This is where it get's fun...

- Absolutely no change in presentation.  The game looks and plays (other than the quarterback mode, which thanfully can be disabled) exactly as 2005.  The only changes seem to be updated rosters and player ratings.  A huge disappointment considering they have exclusive rights to the ESPN presentation formerly held by NFL2K.  The commentary even seems to be identical.

- Superstar mode kind of sucks.  Decisions you make seem to have little or no impact to your players ratings.  There just seems to be no logic in how different choices (and outcomes) affect your player.  This mode, while cool in theory, really was not played out well.

- In the quarterback mode, if you throw a pass to a receiver not in your line of sight, you'll throw the most ridiculous 'dead duck' that you'll ever see.  These guys are NFL quarterbacks...I've see children that can throw a tighter spiral.

- The online mode has a painful registration process.  You basically have to pay $2 to keep ESPN from spamming your email.  Infuriating.

Bottom Line:

Not only did EA get lazy as a result of the lack of competition in NFL video games (lack, how about none), but they bumped the price of the games back up to $50.  Save yourself the money and rent first.  I'll stick with 2005...",I suspected this...,1123545600,121,,

56025,2.0,False,"08 27, 2004",A2X8KN82L07RSK,B00020V4NK,C. Johnson,"It seems EA will never fix their obvious AI problems.  Yet each year they add more gimmicks without fixing one of the main problems in their football game.

I haven't bought Madden since Madden 03, and I will not buy another Madden title until they fix the AI problems.  I am sick of having CPU's sub par running backs breaking 5 and 6 tackles on 3rd and 6 just so they can get a first down.  QBs breaking tackles from LBs who outweight them by 100 pounds.  How about the CPU always allowing your CB's to be out of position when the CPU passes the ball, and on top of that, they slow the CB down to give the receiver a better chance to catch the ball!  Sub par receivers making leaping one handed catches in tight coverage while getting hit.  Passes going through defenders' bodies, helmets, hands, legs, arms etc. to end up in the receiver's hands.  Balls changing direction in mid air just so the receiver can catch it.  The CPU intentionally making tacklers dive in the opposite direction you expect them to, turning a would be minimal 2 or 3 yard gain into a maddening 20 yard gain.  Your defenders all seem to be conntected by a string so if you go in and dive to make a sack and miss (and most of the time you will miss or the QB will miracously break the tackle), your defender who is guarding the intended receiver, will automatically dive too if you switch to him, resulting in a BS 50+ yard TD pass.  The CPU automatically moving your linemen across the line on 3rd and 10, to give the offense a free 5 yard and then the CPU gets exactly 5 yards on the next play.  CPU QB's getting off perfect passes while having a LB inches from taking him down.

If your offense you have to deal with your all star 95+ rated receivers dropping wide open passes.  All star QBs throwing balls out of bounds. All star RB's fumbling at the worse possible time.  You lineman are moved across the line by the CPU and you get flagged for a false start.  Your linemen miss obvious blocks so big gains are rare in a close game. Your QB automatically tucks the ball and takes a sack if a defender is 10 feet away, while the CPU QB can get a perfect pass off while he's being sacked almost.  Psychic defense that almost always know what play your going to run.  Refs almost always get in the way of your receiver when you absolutely need to convert a 3rd down.

And who can forget the infamous comeback AI?  No lead is safe.  Even if your up by 20+ points at the half, your better off running the clock out starting in the 3rd quarter because the AI will do any and everything to get the lead and screw you; that includes your offense fumbling the ball, receivers dropping wide open passes, refs constantly calling clipping and holding on you after you get a good punt return or big gain.  Refs calling you for face mask penalties or pass interference after you stop the CPU on third down so the CPU can get a free first down, bad calls in the final two minutes of the game so you can't challenge.

On special teams I have seen where I was lined up for the game winning field goal and I see my play clock is about to run out, so I call a timeout with 2 seconds left on the clock. The screen signals that I called a timeout, but a few moments after I call a timeout, the ref throws a flag AFTER the timeout was called. and I get pushed back five yards. Talk about a LATE whistle. Another occasion the CPU punted to me, and the ball CLEARLY went out of bounds at the 35 yard line. It was way beyond the side line and in fact nearly to the end of the thick white line; however the ball bounced back in bounds and the CPU downed it at the 21 yard line. I was so shocked, that I saved the replay. No matter what this CPU does to screw me, they always do one better everytime I play the game.

I have experienced these things and more in Madden.  More so on defense.  while these problems certainly don't happen in every game, it happens on average every other game.  Sometimes the CPU will cheat on every single down making it impossible to win. Most of the time however, I can usually still win in spite of the cheating, it is still very frustrating when the CPU can constantly pull 60, 70 and 80 YD TD passes out their a$$ just so the game will be close.  This ruins the experience of an otherwise fun game.  I still play 2003, because I want to at least get my money's worth and play all 30 seasons while drafting college players from NCAA 2003.  After that, I will never even think about purchasing or playing another Madden or NCAA title again.

For me, gone are the days that I rush out and buy the current year's sports title.  It is usually the same game as the previous one.  However, if you absolutely want a football title this year, get ESPN, and while it has its problems too, it is certainly a much better deal being only 20 bucks versus 50 bucks for Madden.

Since the folks at EA are shaking in the fear of a little competition from ESPN, they have decided to purchase the NFL liscense exclusively for themselves so no other companies can make NFL games.  Because of this I suppose I won't be buying any football titles for the next 5 years.  Even IF EA fixed their obvious game problems during these 5 years, I STILL wouldn't buy Madden or NCAA ever again.  I don't even know if I will buy another EA game period.  I am sorry I just can't support any company that buys their way out of competition.  So long EA!",Don't waste your money on this cheating game.,1093564800,3,,
208389,2.0,False,"11 4, 2010",A1UJ8BZ0MYO4G3,B0030F1DOO,jaysim,"As everyone should know by now, ""The Force Unleashed II"" is a sequel, and therefore the story picks up where it left off. Combining three of the most powerful game creation software systems into a single game - Digital Molecular Matter, the Havok physics engine, and Euphoria - this game somehow manages to both work beautifully and suck terribly.

1. STORY: The story is supposed to ""stand on its own"", but instead it feels somewhat like the middle season of a soap opera with no ability to see the beginning or ending. The concept as it stands now comes dangerously close to breaking the ""cloning"" lore created in the early nineties by Timothy Zahn - that Jedi can be cloned, but it does not work very well - and so one is left hoping that this ""clone"" is merely a mind-wiped Starkiller. The story itself is poor, underdeveloped, and a haphazard mess of cliches and awesome action sequences. Instead of ""stand[ing] on its own"", it barely stands with the first game, the story of which was infinitely better, though still worse than most games of today. Also, the ending Light/Dark choice is made by pressing either the R1 or L1 shoulder buttons. It feels like a complete cop-out. (1/5)

2. COMBAT: Much like the first game, this title is filled to the brim with it. While it was somewhat easy to handle in TFU, in this title it gets annoying very quickly. From point A, the intro, to point B, the ending, there is nothing but combat. For some, this may not be such a bad thing, but when you're surrounded by some of the most beautiful scenery ever seen in a game, the lack of opportunities to take a breather goes from annoying to nightmarish. However, unlike TFU, Force powers feel considerably more powerful and useful: Force Repulse in the first game felt like a joke, while here it actually has a decent use in either one-hit-killing enemies or at least knocking them over. Lightsaber combos feel much more fluid, as well. The targeting mechanic, however, feels clumsier than in TFU: rather than using a standard reticule, an outline appears on the target, which is harder to see and harder to direct. Also, if there are enemies about and you want to toss some containers at them for a quick kill or stun - too bad, the game fights with you and likes to target the enemy instead. (2/5)

3. CAMERA: The camera is neither improved nor worsened, though occasionally it got hung up on walls in tight spaces. It never gets hung up on enemies, which is nice, and has less of a tendency to ""pop"" from place to place than it did in TFU. (4/5)

4. GRAPHICS: Quite honestly one of the most beautifully-rendered, highly-detailed games on the market to date, and it benefits wonderfully from the PlayStation 3's Blu-ray capabilities. From sheets of rain pouring down Kaminoan windows to the shine on Vader and the Stormtroopers' armor to the atmosphere of Dagobah, the game never fails to disappoint. For this alone it is worth a day's rent. The three engines only make the graphics stand out even more wonderfully, and honestly, the graphics tend to make an otherwise highly linear and cramped game feel bigger and far more open. The vistas on Cato Neimodia alone are enough to make your jaw drop a little at times. The uncanny valley feeling of the first game has been toned down; the contrast between the in-game graphics and the pre-rendered cutscenes is virtually nonexistent. (5/5)

5. LENGTH: As has been said by many other reviewers, the game is horribly short. Tearing through the single-player campaign, without taking detours for collectibles or what little exploration there is, takes about five to six hours on Easy. TFU was only about eight to ten hours with a moderate replay value; while TFU2 has replay value, it is a little bit lower than for the first game, if only because many of the PS3's trophies will be received within the first playthrough. Some of the trophies provide an entertaining experience, however, considering that one of them requires you to cause a certain number of Stormtroopers to jump to their deaths. The ""challenges"" available from the main menu also add entertainment value, with the ability to log in to the PlayStation Network and rank on the leaderboards. (3/5)

6. DIALOGUE: both improved over and worse than the first game. Starkiller is about as annoying as Anakin, especially during the final level, though what he says when tricking Stormtroopers into doing his bidding is quite amusing. As always, Rahm Kota is entertaining and snarky, though his constant demands to do what he's telling you to do can get extremely obnoxious after the first two or three times. ""Stop Helping Me"" comes into effect fairly often - you are never given the chance to really figure out anything by yourself. Juno Eclipse was virtually nonexistent throughout the game, so her dialogue was, in that way, far improved. Boba Fett's voice actor also does a great job, but Yoda just sounds like bad fanfiction. The return of a certain Ensemble Darkhorse from TFU was like a breath of fresh air. Overall, the whole thing is really hit-or-miss - even Vader gets obnoxious really quickly. (3/5)

7. PLAYIBILITY: The controls feel much smoother and tighter than in the first game. For the PS3, the controls are wonderfully intuitive, though the lack of Sixaxis support make the falling sequences a little tougher for some. Starkiller rarely goes hopping off ledges or straight into the path of death, as he did in the first game. The only real complaint, as before, are the controls used for the Force Grip - it is more difficult to toss things around now, though easier to remember which stick does what. (5/5)

OVERALL: Definitely a renter, this game is not worth its full price. It is worth getting for its status as, honestly, a work of art, though it suffers from length, dialogue, and continued Force Grip issues. May the Force be with you.

That is honestly the case with this Wii Fit Rechargeable Battery Pack for the Wii Balance Board. The battery pack shorts after a few uses, and needs constant recharging. While it does honestly work well with Wii Fit & Wii Fit Plus, it doesn't hit that nail on the head well while in use with other titles that use the Wii Balance Board like Wii Music, and Mario & Sonic At The Olympic Winter Games. Overall, I really recommend another battery pack for the Wii balance board, or just using your regular batteries for the balance of the board. This battery pack really is a waste of your wallet.

NFSU2 installs and looks like the best car game ever made, but it isn't. As the intro screen finishes its loading you find yourself inside Grand Theft Auto, a map in the corner, someone telling you to go to a flashing icon and you drive off to some race to acquire more cash, win more cars and get some turbo and tuning. The graphics on a 256mb card look smashing, beautiful reflections, fast driving through the city... but it just falls short because... that is all it is about.

Having played Burnout 3, virtually the same type of game, nothing like Burnout 1 or 2, I have to say than 3 beats this games hands down, not because of the quality of graphics, or the accuracy of the car models, but simply because it is more apt for this games title and also offers crash control physics where you can spin your car in slow motion, win more points via damages... oh wait I am reviewing another game now... and really that says it all.

NFSU2 is really just a STFU2 in comparison to much better games out there. Although it looks gorgeous and that first drive is a creamer Burnout 3 just leaves this one spinning. It is just not as fast, not as creative and not as enjoyable as the real new hot trail blazer.

Play it when it becomes a cheap classic in two years time and instead get in the better ride next door. You will thank yourself that you did.

Pros

. Graphics are 256mb card worthy.

I'm a fan of FPS shooters, but I've always been limited to gameplay similar to Half Life, nothing at all like Battlefield, so I was excited to get the game installed, and launched.

Origin is an attempt at rooting out Steam as a major digital provider platform. It's not as well polished, and annoying for me to have to install. I figured that I could get used to it, as I was only going to install one game via it (which still made it pointless)

From there, I had more issues with several necessary updates, to Origin, the browser, installing security features, being forced to manually update other security components that the programs were unable to do automatedly, and then finally get slapped with an additional massive update patch to the game. All in all, the first day was spent downloading and updating everything.

This was also bearable, since the game had just launched. I thought it would be okay.

I began having logging in issues. My computer screen would stay black, and I couldn't get into the game. This was disappointing, as it happened at least 3/5 times I logged into a server. While I was able to play, it was great. I was extremely involved in the game. It worked well on my computer.

Ultimately, I would have played the game a lot better if the interface leading up to the gameplay was better. Launching from browser is a crap idea, all the levels of security are even more crap.

I have eagerly awaited each (main) entry in the series, and I felt that each new title was an improvement over the previous one. #1 was shocking in its novelty, #2 (battling a giant croc in the sewers, among other things) was an absolute blast, and #3 (constantly fleeing from Nemesis) was thrilling. #4 was a quantum leap for Resident Evil, and it was exciting to see how vastly improved everything had become- the pacing, the controls, the camera, the combat, even small things, like the inventory system. Although #5 had its critics, I feel that it's the best in the series, taking all the improvements of #4, and improving upon them with HD graphics, and a stunning attention to detail.

But as for #6... I have no idea what happened, and this is, unfortunately, my least favorite of the series. This is not a good Resident Evil game... in fact, it's not a good game, by any standard. The most glaring sin here is a bizarre camera that ultimately makes the game unplayable for me. For some strange reason, Capcom chose to ignore the conventions of standard TPS camera rules. Instead of placing the camera at a reasonable distance behind your character's shoulder, it's jammed right up against them. This results in jerky, choppy motions when you turn from side to side, and for the first time in my life, I experienced motion sickness while playing a game. Another disadvantage of this approach is that it makes the graphics look far worse than #5, since the camera is constantly jammed up against every texture, leaving no room to cover the blemishes (the still photos look nothing like this game's poor performance in motion). Furthermore, you can't even see around you... your visibility is so severely limited, it's the final straw in making this game unplayable for me.

I had been eagerly anticipating this game since its announcement, but I can't even continue playing it. I am beyond disappointed. Capcom, please go back to the approach used in #4 and #5, and please consider releasing a patch that would enable a traditional third person camera in this game.

Yes, it has pretty PLANTS. Hours and hours of them. But if your definition of ""graphics"" goes beyond ""plants"" then Crysis graphics are dead generic.  For the, ahem...Best Graphics Of All Time I could have used a bit more variety, is all I'm saying.  Apart from the end when things get otherworldly, you're looking at the same stuff the whole time. It's much the same for the enemies.  Not much changes between baddies apart from the weapons they use.  I should add that the ""Korean"" enemies you mow down are voiced with such badly stereotyped, fake accents they left me cringing.  I'm not known for my PC sensibilities, but if Asians start returning this game I wouldn't blame them.

Like Halo, Crysis suffers from Slow Running Character Syndrome.  You'd think that between sprint mode and powered super sprint mode you'd be spared that ""feet in molasses"" feeling.  But super sprint is--bizarrely--only good for 2 second bursts, so you're left ""sprinting"" everywhere in unpowered mode no matter how hard you mash that shift key.  So, cajillion dollar power armor notwithstanding, you leisurely jog through Crysis.  A pretty big design flaw of the Nano suit, if you ask me.  I hope they kept the receipt. You'd also think all the vehicles would help, but the vehicles are fragile, gutless clunkers, which lurch around so alarmingly you're happy to ditch them.  Have none of these designers played that swamp boat level in Half-Life 2 that wore out my grin muscles it was so fun?  What are they teaching in game design school these days that drains all the fun out of vehicular mayhem?

And what ever happened to BOSSES? You know, those things that you occasionally fight at the end of levels which make games vastly more interesting and non-repetitive?  Crysis doesn't do bosses.  It doesn't even do ""boss situations"" where things ramp up in intensity before the level ends.  Your character is there to mark off his checklist and punch out.  Where's the pacing?

What Crysis does do well is firefights.  There is endless, chaotic, gun-blazing fun to be had.  The enemy AI is pretty good which is rare.  They'll surprise you with flanking maneuvers and strategic use of grenades.  So if this is your main prerequisite for an FPS you may want to check it out.

Our biggest problem is that our machine, only one year older than the game's release date, with a decent graphics card, does not have the right setup for this game's graphics rendering.  Stuff flashes in and out of visibility, the cursor comes and goes, people's arms detach from their bodies, and any prolonged animated scene completely mucks up the whole works to the point that the machine has to be rebooted (IF we can access the save screen at all).

We may have been willing to fight longer if the game had drawn us in more, but the puzzles just aren't as interesting as they were in the original, except for a couple of good mathematically-based ones.  Also, the puzzles were extremely linear; there was rarely a matter of collecting information in general towards solving one of several open mysteries (as one encounters in, say, Riven), but always just one puzzle you needed to solve at a time, and always of the ""solve this so you can get past this door/bridge"" variety, which got a bit repetitive.

For another thing, I'm familiar with the series (as far back as the first three NES games, to the SNES one, and Symphony of the Night), so I thought this would like those.  Well... the gameplay mechanics are here, it seems, but everything else...

Lets figure this out piece by piece.  First, the graphics were okay.  Even though they're dark, and even though they're a bit lacking in animation (only THREE frame to show the main character running??!), the style was okay, and it added to the environments.

The sound was nice, and the music was great, but everything here just seemed like it could be done much better (the music sounds a bit MIDI-ish, but the melodies are good).

The controls... here's where everything really goes down hill.  I'm no stranger to the Castlevania control scheme, having playing the first four games.  However, for reasons I cannot fathom, this game has by far the worst control setup of all of them (which says alot, because I've replayed the first three games recently, and they haven't aged that well).  First, controling your character is much like controling a big wooden stick.  While the same could be said for the first four games in the series, this game takes it to far worse extremes, especially when considering the enemies move so much better (in other words, they're attacks seem more suited to a game that has you moving your character as franticly as a Mega Man X or Mega Man Zero game).  Also, the option to have the whip spin by itself became rather annoying.  Unlike Castlevania 4, which allowed you to move the whip around by holding the attack button down, this one only makes it spin on it's own, which is somehow amazingly counter-productive.  Some of the abilities are nice (high jump, wall jump, etc...), but they don't alieviate this problem much, and actually require over-utilization in some areas (trust me, you would never survive the final battle without high jump).

Now the gameplay.  I've played other games that used the ""Metroid-vania"" style (free exploration, found in Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow, as far as the ones I've played).  Somehow, this one takes that system and just makes you lost.  Seriously, this castle was not as fun to explore as all of the others.  The boss battles (mostly refering to the last 4) were super cheap, requiring me to over-use the DSS system to the most extreme, which was a far cry from the more ""down to earth"" battles from Castlevania 4 and Aria of Sorrow.  Much as I enjoy difficulty, I can't stand not being able to have a clear shot at a target with my whip due to the enemy being over-sized or too quick to dodge.

This is by far one of my most hated Castlevania games.  If you even think about buying this game (since a lot of other people liked it), I recommend you find a way to rent it first.  Otherwise, you may get yourself into a snag like I did.  Lucky for me, this was only $15 at K-Mart, which is about as low as GBA games get.",Ack!  Weak game.,1097452800,7,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The comedy and emotional impact varies, but this is one of the weaker the series has to offer - I don't know if the folks at High Impact Games couldn't get any of the team from R&C's home Insomniac Studios, because while it holds the game together it's nothing spectacular and lacks the comic feel that makes other R&C games more forgivable.
Story: 6.0/10

I know this is just a port from a PSP game, but while being playable on the small screen it doesn't translate well to a larger screen, even if you can forgive ugly texturing. Graphical anomalies, jagged edges and flickering polygons happen relatively frequently. PS2 owners can rotate the camera at will by the right analog stick, but the motion is more sluggish than other R&C games.
Graphics: 4.5/10

You can only choose between stereo and mono, but at least the sound effects are acceptable. Nothing exceptional, but passable.
Sound: 6.0/10

Ratchet & Clank has generally had relatively quirky music, some more dramatic pieces in Going Commando. While nothing's specifically bad here, it's also forgettable at best.
Music: 5.0/10

Action, adventure, and platforming has always been what Ratchet & Clank is all about. This is good enough for a fix, but it's nothing specifically good. Completionists will be especially frustrated, because there are a wealth of bugs, clip errors, and registry failures and there were absolutely no fixes in porting it from PSP to PS2. One of the things that Insomniac always seemed to hit squarely was the margin for error that made it challenging but not frustrating, and High Impact Games dropped the ball there.
Gameplay: 4.5/10

I only score this aspect this highly because it has the same 'Challenge Mode' that all Ratchet & Clank games had (except Quest for Booty). You keep items and experience from one play to another, but the game gets no easier or more enjoyable for it.
Replayability: 6.0/10

I wanted to like this game, and hoped that the fact that it was ported meant that it showed enough promise to be given some extra polish and another chance. It was never given any attention beyond making it run on the larger console. The lack of smooth play or forgiving margin makes it more frustrating than fun, and I'd have to recommend the rest of the series and other adventure/platformers before this.

PROS:
-The execution system is a neat idea and good feature
-The blue circles above guns if there is ammo and the red circles above guns if there isn't ammo is a GREAT idea (I am sure this may have been featured in other games in the past that I've never played, but this was the first I've seen such a feature in a game and I cannot tell you how many times I've wanted something like this in a game to save time)

-TERRIBLE graphics (this coming from someone who couldn't usually care less about graphics because gameplay > graphics always IMO)

I was hoping this game would at least capture some elements from the movie, but instead it seems like the story is just a jumbled mess. Also, nothing is more annoying than the same repetitive environments with the same pointless enemies, the same few methods of execution, and all this while trying to remember what the heck the controls are as they are very bizarre.

The real thing is almost as bad.
The controllers are not too different from the last gen, which is a plus for me.  At least the original one that came with is pretty good.
Still need to buy a spare.  Hopefully the aftermarket MS controllers are equally good.

Where this falls apart for me is the user interface.  Anyone with eyes can see the Xbone interface is a reworked version of Windows 10 - which most people I know, including myself, do not care for.  It has a Playskool feel to it.  Like if we were 6 and using a ""My First Console"" interface.
It doesn't even need to be said that the 360 interface was more useful, the Xbone interface is bad enough to be stand on it's own as bad.
I was able to get most of the bloat off the main screen, and I was also able to pin the things I wanted to the home screen, but it still is a pain to navigate.  The things I use take forever to get into, often buried several layers into useless menus.

Something as simple as starting a party chat is needlessly cumbersome, requiring more clicks / taps / A button presses than seems necessary.
Around half the time I try to get into a party, it comes up with an unknown network error.  Great work there - I am clearly online, and can see my friends who just invited me to the party chat - obviously THAT part of the network knows I on - why doesn't party chat?
On the plus side, once you get into a party with your friends, frequently you cannot be heard at all, or hear anyone else.  So you get to leave the party, and roll the dice again to see whether you will go back to unknown network error, a connection that isn't connecting, or the rare time when you actually get to talk with folks.

It is kind of neat that you can add external storage, but it begs the question - why ship with 500 gigs when they know darn well that will only hold 10 to 20 games, depending on size?
Clearly the idea was to keep the price down, and pass on the inconvenience to us, the loyal customers.  Thanks MS!

Another thing that happens to me, is my controller (yes, after updating) will sometimes just lose sync.  Can turn it off and on, and maybe 3 of 10 times it will re-sync.  When it doesn't, there is nothing for it, but to be hard shut down.  Delicate electronics just LOVE this process.

The promised ""NEXT GEN"" graphics are meh, even on games that are only released on next gens consoles - what I am saying is this is NOT games from the 360 that were ported out to Xbone, but on games that were built from the ground up to specifically utilize the next gen hardware.

And for some reason, next gen comes without voice messages.  Nothing like typing out a message instead of just being able to speak it.

Sure there is more, but I lose interest, much like the console itself.  I find myself going back and using my 360 more than my Xbone.

In fact we have been presented with Glitch-city. I have never run in to a Borderlands game,or any game for that matter, that has had so many glitches. One is bad enough,but I am only about half way through and there are four major faults with this game already.
The first biggie is the fact that they have for the first time made playing with friends the default mode. In games past it has always been the user which has determined whether to connect and play with friends,play solo,or what have you. I prefer solo first,as I always wish to learn a game on my own ,so if I do decide to play with friends,I have somewhat of an idea of how to play without embarrassing myself.
The second one is if you change it to offline(solo) it does NOT remember your selection for the next time you play. That is every game you return to play you have to pick your choice of how to play all over again. C'mon.
Thirdly, as you approach a door to the first boss battle(against Deadlift),it does no open!?? That's right,there is no access or continuance of play beyond that area. The only way to get around it is to play solo(offline) and then it will open. I only found that out by trial and error.
Fourth and finally there is a Vault key symbol in the Titan Robot Production Plant...the only one. You approach it to press""e"" to discover it, but it won't let you. You cannot discover the symbol. So there goes your perfect game,if you,like me,are trying to obtain one.
As I say I am not all the way through yet,so who knows what else I will find.
On the good side the game's controls and handling are pretty much the same from previous versions. And they give you an in game ""reward"" if this game detects any other installed version of Borderlands.
All in all a Borderlands all players of the previous versions will appreciate. However the glitches are something that should NOT be in a game like this and in that many numbers. Somebody screwed up royally in the testing department. It is not what we previous Borderlands players and/or newbies to the game should find when shelling out our hard earned bucks. 2 1/2-3 stars. And don't get me started on the guide(see my review on that)!
Nov. 11/14 Update:
Well I have finished the game and of course have found more glitches. There is what they call a ""grinder"" machine. It works by inputting three items from your back pack into it,and even moonstones that you collect,to make an entirely new weapon. Well,it doesn't work...never has,never will. I have noticed that if you travel back through a boss area you have been through and defeated,they respawn again! I can see its minions respawning but the boss? Also from the ""Hyperion Hub of Heroism""level forward,when you come near a Vault symbol to press ""e"" to discover them,you will find when you do they have already been discovered....but you haven't been there before! Lastly there is a side mission called""To Arms"".In it you have to find a box and donate about 52 weapons to it. Well every time you come back to the box,you press""e"" to open your back pack(and donate).However despite your back pack being FULL of weapons,it will tell you there are none!???? So of course there goes your donations down the drain AND any hopes of ever completing this side mission.
On this date there was a patch installed through Steam for the PC games. From what little I can see,there is no difference. All the items mentioned above are still extant.
So is this game worth your hard earned bucks on,or your parents dollars? Unless you just HAVE to have this,I would recommend backing off for a year or two.

There has been a trend recently to reverse the gamist influence of tabletop role-playing games on their video game counterparts.  Consoles don't lend themselves well to complex rules systems and designers find their beautifully rendered enemies disrupted by floating hit point numbers over their heads.  In response, Alone in the Dark goes full simulationist - forget the rules, this is all about horror!

And so Alone in the Dark, like Silent Hill, starts out in media res. You learn to play as you go by ferociously clicking buttons to blink your eyes so you can see straight.  You play an amnesiac anti-hero with a secret connection to a certain stone held by a certain priest.  A bald villain, named Crowley (yet another mystical foe named after Aleister Crowley, the occultist), marches you to your doom until he is disrupted by something even scarier: extradimensional tears in the fabric of reality.

Thing is, extradimensional tears aren't all that scary.  The entity that is in charge enjoys possessing hot chicks and growling in a deep voice, instantly rendering the villain rather mundane. Those looking for the Cthulhu Mythos-inspired connection that suffused the original Alone in the Dark will find the chatty archnemesis lacking.

What Alone in the Dark does very well is completely conceal the rules from the player.  Our hero can only carry so many items in his jacket - no unlimited, unrealistic inventory here!  He can swing weapons or even light them on fire, and the fire mechanics allow him to do everything from blast explosive bottles out of the air to pouring flammable liquid on his bullets so they shoot fire.  Realistic, huh?

There are no hit points, no health meters, and not much in the way of rules.  What Alone in the Dark lacks in gamist structure it makes up for in narrativist railroading, with a capital R.

Alone in the Dark is hellbent on telling a story, and the developers just happen to drag the player along for the ride.  It even has a function to allow you to skip any scene, with a brief montage at the beginning of each replay to describe what happened ""previously, in Alone in the Dark..."" I played a car chase sequence fifty times before I gave up. I ran around with a flashlight trying to make some black goo not eat me (repeatedly watching the starting sequence of a sewer worker swearing effusively before being eaten) thirty times before I gave up. I teetered inside a precariously balanced bus on the edge of the cliff dozens of times before the game crashed.

And so we have Alone in the Dark's problem - if you want to make a game all about story, it better be a good story.  Alone in the Dark provides absolutely no guidance as to what to do next.  You are guaranteed to die over and over until you figure it out, which renders any interesting cut scene or curious camera angle meaningless after the fifth time.  The game is a buggy mess too.  It crashes constantly; at one point, a villain just stood there and let me whack at him to no effect. Maybe he felt bad for me.

Alone in the Dark tries hard, but like an action blockbuster, it has no interesting story to tell.  With stereotypical villains, enemies that aren't scary, frustrating camera angles, and a railroading plot that will have you tearing your hair out, Alone in the Dark will leave players alone in the dark.",Leaves players in the dark,1290643200,3,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

Primal rage is a game about seven dino-gods who are set free from their prisons when a disaster strikes ""Urth"" in the near future. The player's goal is to defeat the other dino-gods, conquer their lands, gain the most number of worshippers and end up ruling the new urth. The concept sounds okay, but the game which follows the story is not really.
When you turn on the game and arrive at the title screen, you may think the background bird sounds are cool. But go to the player select screen and from there it's all downhill. The sound and music quality is more like that of a Sega Genesis game. Then there are weird scratching noises at times, and a horrible ""continue screen"" music that will make you drop the controller and run for an asprin! The graphics are slightly easier to handle. The seven monsters are reasonable, especially the t-rex duo Sauron and Diablo. Sometimes however you may find yourself trying to identify which is the head and tail in the middle of the action. The backgroung visuals are also decent. But the fatalities...are terrible. They are nowhere near the quality of Mortal Kombat. It's hard to actually figure out what they are doing in some.
Then there are the special moves. Some of them are okay (like Diablo's ""hot foot""), and some of them are not (like Chaos's ""farts"" and ""puke""). Talk about weirdness. The character Vertigo is ridiculous. A dinosaur with the head of a cobra and the tail of a scorpion? Some special moves are hard to identify as what they're supposed to be. The controls aren't quite what you'd want. The characters are poor at jumping, and even slow and clumsy on ground. It's sometimes hard to identify if the move they are performing is a special move or just a normal one. Oh, I said something of the sort above, didn't I?
So if you want a Genesis quality game for your SNES (you're nuts), then you can buy this. But what's the point? The SNES has much more eye-candy and easier to control fighting games out there.

I'd just bought a mechanical key board but it seemed to lag when playing games leading to slow response in fight/flight situations. Well, this fixed that. The cherry red keys are MUCH more quiet and work smoothly. When not playing games I prefer my other keyboard for the click and feel, but with games not so much. Now what I don't like. First, it is a decent keyboard. The problem is value. I paid seventy US for it and it just isn't worth nearly that much imho. It comes with two sets of replacement key caps: one WASD with one texture on them (and grey instead of the keyboard's black) and another set of 6 keys which I forget (except for the R which I'm using) with a *slightly* different texture (this is subjective and based on the sensitivity of my old finger tips, ymmv). The replacement keys are also slanted, I suppose theoretically they are more ergonomic when playing a game (with your left hand hovering over that part of the keyboard). I like the different color, the different texture, and the slant. To be honest, I find the slant tells my finger tips more than the texture does. You can program the back lighting (or should I call it through lighting since it glows thru the keys (as well as around them slightly). That's cool to look at. For about 30 seconds then, not so much. I buy lit keyboards to help me SEE the keys, not to look cool and the special effects (pulsing, trails, rain, etc.) don't help much. I've turned it off and have the lighting at a constant medium level. The brightest setting is too bright for me, the dimmest too dim, so I'd say they got that right (although I would have preferred a few more increments in between lowest and highest intensity). I really miss the hand rest, I think for the price, it should have come with one. (My other keyboard (iirc) didn't have one either but I don't miss it there. Maybe because unlike the Strafe, the other has two legs so you can raise (slant) the top of the keyboard. The Strafe has no such option. (Although I suppose I could shim it with something and get the same effect.) I really don't like the shift key symbols (on the number keys: ~!@#$%^&*()_+) NOT being lit hardly at all. When I'm hunting for the $ sign, I have to look, and the fact that the symbol is barely illuminated knocks this down an entire star. No programming of keys (except for lighting patterns. (One sorta programming thing is that pressing a key can cause that key to light up and gradually fade, but other than lighting effects, nada.) I find myself constantly being in Caps Lock mode and while the light stripe at the top right of the keyboard clearly indicates it, I really don't like that kind of surprise while in some tight corner in a game. As far as macros and changing default key assignments, look elsewhere, this doesn't have it. As far as lighting colors other than red - ditto. It solved the lag problem I was seeing (I wonder if the lack of programming (or reprogramming) of keys makes it faster? IDK). It allows slightly better finger centering (what do you call knowing where your fingers are on the keyboard? kinesthesia? yeah, that's improved a bit, but not as much as I'd hoped. To sum up: adequate for the intended purpose, but WAY overpriced (on sale for seventy). Do people really game with the keyboard lighting up in patterns? Wow, I'd be distracted.

It does so many things well, the pacing is awesome, the player is constantly hooked, and there are lots of creative ideas, but then it's punctuated with instances where you'll just want to put a hole in the wall.

It's as if the development team was working on the game, high-fiving each other for their great ideas, everyone's having a good time when an executive comes in and says ""you know what? We need to make the player work harder. You need to make this boss battle last 30 minutes, I know the player has been shooting and killing stuff this whole time, but this boss is invulnerable and the player has to figure out our little secret on how to hurt it, and after 20 minutes of button mashing, the boss will use his superpower and do quadruple the damage"" As a player do you like fighting a boss using repetitive methods for 20 minutes and then suddenly be killed because the boss forgot to use it's megapower earlier? OK, you can memorize the patterns and the next time it happens you'll be ready for it, except now there is another new pattern you have to figure out. OK, so you memorized this new pattern and now you're ready again, I bet you feel real smart for memorizing the developer's patterns don't you? Are you having fun now? NO! Because this is what developers could do and get away with in the 80s, but it's been two decades of video game growth since then. In the 80s when video games were zygotes, the developer created a pattern which the player had to figure out, once the player figured out the pattern, the dev would make a new pattern, and the player would figure it out and master it again. This method quickly becomes repetitive but when video game technology was in it's infancy and designed to eat up quarters at arcades, the developers could get away with it. But now everyone has a cell phone, the Soviet Union is no more...you know...things change. Today, the developers ask themselves, ""what would be fun for the player, what can we do to make it challenging without loosing its fun, and how do we constantly innovate?""

Retro studios fulfills half of that, and then shoots itself in the foot. For every great idea they have, they balance it with a bad idea. I was hooked on this game from the start. You begin in the cockpit of Samus's ship, even though you don't get to fly it, you can manipulate the ship and explore the interior. It's immersive. The puzzles are fun, the controls work well although the menu system is clunky, the combat is fluid and smooth even though the Wii-mote is fidgety, the narrative is just good enough to push the action along, and then you'll get stuck and can't figure out where to go. You'll back track and exhaust all ideas and then look for an online guide and then find out that you have to bomb out an obscure part of a wall to gain access to a tunnel.  Sometimes you'll run around a room and can't figure out where to go and after 20 minutes, you'll realize that there is a muddy looking ledge that is semi hidden in the shadows. The art design is superb, but this game really needs a HD upgrade for better resolution, shadows and textures.

Despite all these flaws, it's still fun enough to keep enduring the pain...until you run out places to put a hole in your wall and then you have no wall left to put a hole into and you just can't go on anymore. If you have enough space on your wall, however, you're in for a real treat.

Furthermore, the looks of the game are decent, as well as the controls and overall atmosphere.

That being said, there are enough negatives to bring this game down to 2 stars, at least for me. First and foremost, a common issue that many people have been complaining about is the status of the Rainbow Six servers. Even writing this review, at least a month after release, the servers have presented a massive gameplay issue; in the course of an hour of playing, you will loose connection to the server at least once, and in between these losses, the quality of gameplay ranges substantially (some games are super smooth, others are incredibly glitchy). While this is obviously not a negative about the game itself, it is a substantial detriment to the overall playability, especially considering that there is not much of a single player campaign, which leads perfectly to the next issue.

If you wish to play a single player campaign, similar to the ones in Rainbow six Vegas, or even campaigns in earlier games, you will be heavily disappointed. Instead of an actual campaign, Rainbox Six Siege is instead composed of 10 different 'situations,' increasing in difficulty as you progress, but leaving the player with an absolute lack of a premise or story (especially in contrast to earlier Rainbow Six games). Honestly, playing through them almost seemed pointless, like I was playing more of a tutorial than an actual campaign; better get used to it though considering how often the servers have gone down post-release.

Content is also a little bit of an issue in this game, at least for me. In the multiplayer version of the game, there are 20 different operators (10 for attacking; 10 for defending), that you may choose from, all with their own special ability. I absolutely love the some of the special abilities, and the big learning curve that comes with understanding how to use them most effectively. That being said, the amount of actual content beyond the operators is lacking. For starters, in each operator class, you may only choose one of 2 firearms (many are repeats among different classes). Once you choose the firearms, customization typically starts and ends with the gun sight (there are a few) and the camo pattern on the firearm. Beyond that, unlike previous rainbow six games where you could truly make the operator unique to you, you are unable to customize the look of your operator at all.

This game is another in a long line of games that expects the buyer to not only buy into part of a game, but also spend another $30 bucks on a season pass in order to more 'complete' the game. That being said, after you spend your money, you will still be left void of a campaign/story, operator customization, and adequate servers to actually play the game on.

My recommendation, wait for the price of this game to drop! Do not buy it until it is on sale. Hopefully, between now and then, the issues with the servers will be worked out; but truthfully, as fun as this game is (in its heavily limited state), it is not enough fun to warrant that $60 price tag, with a $30 season pass to add what should already be in the game.",Very fun!

Kaplan,"I don't usually comment about other reviews but the other customer scores here are far, far too generous... which is to be expected on a much-hyped game's first day of release.  Resistance: Burning Skies is not ""2 out of 10""-bad (reference there to Jim Sterling's panning of the game over at Destructoid), but it's certainly not what I would call a good way to spend $40.

Here's where I'm coming from in terms of the Resistance series:  I bought R:Fall of Man way, way back when the PS3 first came out ($600 backwards-compatible PS3 unit, may you rest in peace after your untimely YLOD!) and had a pretty good time with it.  It was lengthy, the level design was sturdy enough, it was challenging, and Insomniac put in some decent reasons to come back to it.  It may not have the most sterling reputation 5+ years later, but it was polished and atmospheric for its time.  Resistance 2, well... I thought it was okay.  The graphics were a little rough and the game felt too sporadic in its movement from location to location, but it was fun in places.  Retribution on the PSP (by Sony Bend, the great studio behind the PSP Syphon Filter games and Uncharted GA for Vita) was a stunning revelation for the little handheld, matching great graphics with a strong story, an abundance of terrific secrets, and some very diverse gameplay.

Finally, there's Resistance 3, which I consider to be not just one of the finest FPSs on the Playstation 3, but one of the finest FPSs to be released, period, since Half-Life 2 came out in 2004.  Insomniac hit their stride with fun multiplayer, a terrific campaign, and plenty of polish.

I mention all of this because, well, imagine my disappointment now that I've spent the last six hours breezing through Resistance: Burning Skies by Nihilistic (their previous work, PlayStation Move Heroes, should have been my first clue).  Look, even if you come into this game telling yourself any twin-stick FPS on a handheld is an impressive feat, even if you set the bar impossibly low, even if you don't care about Resistance as a series, you are probably going to be disappointed by half of this $40 package.

Let's start with the story:  There isn't really any.  All you know is that there have been rumblings about mutants in Europe and you're a fire fighter in New York.  It takes all of thirty seconds for the Chimera to pop up (in burning wreckage, no less), and so begins a mess in which you play a rather vague, nondescript firefighter (the only thing to remind you of this is your melee weapon, a fireman's axe) who for some reason keeps getting sidetracked on his way over to meet his family in a nearby refugee camp in New Jersey.  There's nothing really sprawling or epic about what happens; you move from bland city location to bland warehouse location to bland cyber lab and so on.  The voice acting is fine; the game's Alyx Vance-like companion, Ellie, is adequate; and the story even musters a genuinely nice moment very late in the game.  Unfortunately, 99% of the game is spent wandering narrow corridors with zero set pieces thrown in, so you quickly forget what your ""character"" is supposedly doing.

""Who cares about story in vidja games?!"" you may retort.  Okay, well, let's move on to the nitty-gritty.  The graphics are a mixed bag.  Some of it (bosses, enemy textures up close, some ally expressions, tunnel sections) looks terrific, some of it looks awful (city street textures, enemy animations, graphical glitches galore).  The sound is perfunctory and at times grating (the chaingun, for instance, cuts out intermittently).  The music sounds good when it's present, which it hardly ever is (most of the game is played in relative silence).

The absolute worst thing, though, is the level design.  Even by R1 standards--the standards of five years ago--this is bad level design.  Again, there are no interesting set pieces, only a few minor teases.  For example, you spend all of five minutes on a giant enemy's back only to spend an additional second or two killing him in the easiest way possible.  A water tower looks like it's about to fall on you... only to to be conveniently stopped by invisible walls.  A bridge is getting fire-bombed... but none of it ever collapses.  And so on.  It's all promise, no delivery.

And this wouldn't be a half-bad homage to the simplistic FPSs of yesteryear (think Painkiller) if the game didn't scream ""UNPOLISHED.""  From the numerous graphical and sound glitches to the extremely short campaign and a final boss whose ""patterns"" and ""strategy"" border on nonsensical, it becomes evident that Nihilistic was probably planning much more than Sony would ever let them deliver given the Vita's strict launch timeline.  This game may have been pretty decent had it received an extra year in the can.

What's worse, your interest in this game should begin and end with the single player game.  I know, I know, what about the multiplayer?  Well, here's the thing: Even if you end up enjoying the multiplayer in the game (and you just might, if you happen to get into a game), you're not going to be there for long.  Resistance 3 had what I would consider to be pretty darn good multiplayer and while Burning Skies is a step up from the cut-and-dry online deathmatch in Resistance: Retribution for PSP, it is so barebones as to be an ugly cousin to R3's multi suite.  And even then, R3's multi had you leveling so quickly, it didn't keep a community around for long.  In Burning Skies, you ""level"" that much faster and see everything there is to see, perks-wise, in the campaign.  Imagine, then, how few people are going to be playing this game in a month or so from now (and subtract 100,000 from your estimate, because you may have forgotten that the Vita hasn't sold too well in the US).

In other words, you may be initially excited to play competent FPS multiplayer on the go, but after that wears off, you'll be reminded that everything is pared down for the sake of squeezing ultra-simple multiplayer into an otherwise rushed and incomplete game.

Really, the best I can say for Resistance: Burning Skies is that a lot of it is merely adequate and it controls decently (if your thumbs can take extended rounds with the Vita's rather short analog sticks).  But I hope you don't really decide to spend $40 on ""adequate"" with a heaping side of ""rushed to market.""  Rent this or wait for the price to come down to $15-20.  Even then, you may be disappointed.  Personally, I'd return it, but I bought it at Best Buy (wah wah waaah).

And if you're still really aching for a FPS to take advantage of the Vita, go back to playing the far superior Uncharted: GA and Unit 13.  Squint enough, and you might forget you're playing 3rd-person shooters.","There's a reason the game's subtitle is ""B.S.""",1338336000,17,,

Unfortunatly the online interface is crap.  If you join a race already in progress you join as a spectator.  When the race is over, a new race starts automatically.  If your a Spectator from the previous race you cannot join new race. These are long races you could be waiting along time expecting to join a race only to get dolced.

If your hosting a game and a race ends, it automatically launches the next map.  You have no option to stop or change maps or vehicles or let new people or spectators join.  You have to start a new room.

Some of these races last anywhere between 20 mins to 1 hour.  When your in the race there is no milage indicator to let you know how much longer you have.  There is not indicator to let a spectator know how much longer the race will be.

From the lobby there is no indication if a race is in already in progress or just forming up and you don't want to join a race that is already in progress becuase then you'll join as spectator. So you can spend an hour going from room to room to room to room waiting to get lucky to join a race that is just about to begin.

you can host a game but because everyone is jerking around going from room to room it can take forever to find a group of guys ready to race.  it frustrating.

If you choose quick match where the system automatically places you in a room you think you'd stand a chance.  guess what 9 times out of ten the system puts you in a room where a race already in progress.  You join as a spectator and you have no option even when the race completes to join the next race.

there are no vehicle stats, there are alot of premade vehicles to choose from, but no info on speed, handling or suspension.  You choose a vehicle because you like the pretty color conbination I guess.

A game at [...] bucks can invoke ire and disappointment but the same game at [...] bucks may be good value.  Afro Samurai is hitting those bargain prices but honstly I still don't think it garners more than a rental.

Fans of the show will be happy to see the voice talent is there, the style, etc.  The graphics, music, and sound are excellent in this game.  But this is also a licensed game tie in and we all know that these types of games are rarely great.  In the grand scheme of things, Afro Samurai is a 3-d action platformer.  Even the best platformers get repetitive and frustrating.  It's up to developers to work in additional elements to keep the game fresh.  I just don't think Afro managed that.  The game ends up being very stale once you cut through the all the style that is slamming you in the face.  A good comparison for this game in the newer ranks would be Tron Evolution.  Both are predominantly fighting games with prince of Persia esque platform elements and solid graphics, music, and sound.  But both games offered all style, little substance.

Lets start with gameplay.

Combat controls:

I have few complaints about the combat controls.  For the most part the controls are intuitive and responsive.  Entering combos is easy and responsive.  Combat and defensive buttons are mapped well.  The two elements I did not like was having to depress the L stick to run and the much hated camera.

I am wagering the devs just ran out of buttons and had to get running in.  But using the L stick is unreliable and uncomfortable.  The camera has been slammed in other reviews but it is a glorified pain.  It spins constantly in combat, often leaving you blind.  While you can block with R trig while you right it (as one reviewer pointed out) they belittle the fact that not all attacks can be blocked or that the parry function is vital in some cases and exercising a parry correctly is impossible if you cant see the enemy.

The game offers a wide variety of combos for you to cut enemies up but most of the time you just mash buttons as fast as possible.  This is fine for regular enemies but in boss fights you can't just mash buttons.  You have to be precise.  The controls are fine once you get accustomed to them but it's unfortunate the game never ""trains"" you to prepare for bosses.

For example.  You never really need to block much during the base levels but vs bosses you have to block most of the time.  Some bosses you can only hit if you use the ""parry"" command, etc.  This creates a disconnect in the levels.  Most players will just ""mash"" their way through the level only to struggle with the boss because the game never ""Trained"" or ""prepared"" them for the boss.  This is a result of bigger issues discussed later on.

Platform Controls:

Purely awful.  It's almost as if the Devs made this a straight combat game and threw in the platforms as a last minute addition.  Afro floats around the levels.  Turning is not very precise, jumping is inaccurate, wall running is a mess, etc.  Add in the wild camera and you are gonna die a lot.  The wall iteration is also pretty lame.  Afro can only interact with predetermined walls, but the player really has no idea which walls they are until you just go for it.

I got about half way through the game before writing this and frankly I have never felt like I am really in control of Afro.  He is just not responsive enough to generate any feeling of fluidity.  Worse off many of the environments are difficult to see your path in.  This poses a problem because you can't always see where you are supposed to go or where the platform is, etc.  Afro acting drunk the whole game doesn't help.

As platformers go this game is pure garbage.

Story:  The game is told in an interesting manner, kind of like Kill Bill.  Unfortunately there just isn't much of it though.  About 75% of this game is combat.  Just mindlessly mashing buttons to slay the same bad guys over and over and OVER and OVER.  Then after maybe 50 baddies you get a small cut scene for a few seconds, then another 50 bad guys come running.

There really isn't any clear reason for most of the fights either.  Enemies just materialize out of nowhere for little reason.  In one level you actually have to run around the same paths over and over just to keep triggering more and more of these monotonous mini battles.  You never have much of a clue as to why you are doing this especially when the goal of the mission was to end up right where you started!

If the story was better I think the game could have been saved some negative press.

Difficulty.  This is a sliding scale.  For the most part the game isn't terribly difficult on the basic level crawling.  Instead of adding more challenges in the form of puzzles or more difficult enemies, the game just pushes you by throwing more and more of the same bad guys on you at the same time.  The game is primarily just a grind of going from one room to another just to fight the same group of 25 bad guys over and over.  Worse, some of these baddies take forever to kill.  Fighting isn't overly challenging it just takes a while.  Its a war of attrition.  The the bosses are actually very challenging.  Sometimes based on pure challenge, others out of frustration.

I got through about half of the game in my first sitting and I am pretty much bored of it.  My hands get tired from just mashing buttons and the platform sections are few and frustratingly bad.  Pure and simple, this game gets boring fast.  I would love to finish the game to see more of the story but it's just not worth the frustration or time commitment.  I would rather read a book or go for a walk.

I find it odd that the game doesn't have a difficulty level.  Instead the game has a set level and if you beat the game you can unlock the ""hard"" difficulty.  I can't imagine this will matter to most gamers.  The game is so monotonous and repetitive that I can't see most gamers playing it over.  I would think an ""easy"" level for more casual gamers (I have never been a big fan of most action platform games even though I was raised on Mario.).  had that Easy level been there I think the more casual gamers like myself would have found the game more enjoyable.  But alas as it stands the game is just stubbornly frustrating.

To play For Honor, you must have a UbiSoft account and be logged in at all times, even in single player mode. Not that campaign mode is worth playing. It consists of three 6 level sections, each designed to introduce the 3 races and character classes within that race (knights, vikings, samurai, in that order). They're basically tutorials, and you are interrupted every level or so with a lesson that pops up in the sidebar and pauses the game (how to block, how to parry, etc). Characters are chosen for you for each level. There's no choice in the matter.

The voice acting is horrible and anachronistic, not befitting an AAA title. The AI is laughable. If you walk away from enemies, they'll wander back to their post and just stand there, giving you time to heal and come back. After several levels, you are given a perk that allows you to heal while not in combat (passive skill), and another that can heal you as needed (with a recharge period).

There are no ranged weapons, and combat is needlessly encumbered with a clunky block/attack scheme. Combat is not fluid or fun, like other fighting/action games (Batman, Ninja Gaiden, or Street Fighter series). To top it off, Ubisoft designed a very stupid stamina bar where each attack takes away energy, yet sprinting does not cause fatigue. When the bar is 75%, the screen washes out to warn you.

So, there's no point to playing single player mode. For multi-player mode, matchmaking takes a LONG time. In my second ever game, match making paired me with 3 bots, against 3 human players.

The GemBox controller rates right up there as far as quality and use, with the bonus of having rechargeable batteries built-in. The Gem Motion wireless remote/keypad is also very nice. But this is where the niceties end.

I am no stranger to the Android OS, every phone I've had since the Nexus One I have rooted and used a custom ROM (well, not my current Note3, this one I just rooted, don't have the time to keep-up with the custom ROMs anymore). With that in mind:
* I had a hard time navigating the setup and configurations of this kit. The included instructions is a single page printed manual (in other words, they shrunk each page to a minuscule size in order to fit them all on a single page, literally requiring a magnifying glass to read...Even if you bothered to find a magnifying glass, the information given are sparse and of almost no actually help.
* The system overall is laggy (sluggish response when choosing things or going form one window to another).
* Finding games that will even install is a chore.
* Most of the games I did finally get to install, didn't work properly; Either the menus couldn't be navigated properly (didn't matter if the controller was in controller or 'mouse' mode) or it just plain didn't start right.

I could go on and on with the all the finer details of issues, but the bottom line here is there's a chasm in Android apps and games usage, between a phone/tablet vs. and a TV with remote/controller.

I completely feel like both 13-2 and LR ruined the good memories of FF13 for me.

LR plays drastically different than the other two (new combat system, new gameplay).  It's got a time/day limit that I've been told is similar to Zelda Majora's Mask - I do not like games that have time limits. Overall gameplay is pretty good, they kinda forced a difficulty spike to encourage multiple replays.  Side quests are not optional.  Story is cheesy.

I didn't absolutely hate it, but I feel incredibly ambivalent toward this game.  I'm hard pressed to give any positives (not even music, at least 13-2 had really good music).  I didn't absolutely hate this game, but while it was okay when I played it, I left the game with an overall negative feeling/impression.

At the end of the day, I definitely feel like the sequels ruined the original for me.  Now that I'm done with these two, I plan to pretend they don't exist in the FF13 timeline lol.

If you liked FF13 a lot, I'd say skip the sequels so they don't ruin the original story and characters.

141397,2.0,False,"04 19, 2011",A3PZ4AXTY9J1DZ,B000VL4J9Q,Jason,"...Is the phrase that comes to mind when someone mentions AION to me.  While Aion boasts some impressive graphics and PvP / PvPvE, the celestial battle ahead is not without some heavy flaws.  This might make the game hard to swallow for some gamers, but a perfect fit for others.

** Do not be put off by my 2 star rating.  Every game is different in the hands of different gamers.  While I may of not enjoyed AION, perhaps you might! **

** GAMEPLAY **
Aion is one of many Fantasy based MMOs on the market.  You could sit back and compare MMO to MMO all day long, from a WoW UI to an Everquest this or that but what it comes down to is how the MMO handles.  In this aspect I feel that Aion has a 'mixed' gameplay feeling.  There are many pros to the gameplay but also quite a few cons that simply refuse to go away it seems.  I've tried Aion at launch, at the 12 month mark and with the new expansion.  In all 3 attempts the gameplay just really didn't do it for me or the PvP experience.

Gameplay PROS:  Aspects about the gameplay I found enjoyable are the use of Macros and fluid combat.  The game boasts some awesome graphics(see DESIGN) and it shines when it comes to environments and combat especially.  Skills look great and animations are very fluid.  In fact it might have some of the best looking combat in any MMO I have played.  The game uses Macros where you can code skills into a single click; This lets you trigger multiple skill combos off without cluttering your skill bar.  While other MMOs have similar features I feel AION has the best implementation of Macros(very simple and easy to program)  The ability for flight is a nice twist on combat.  It comes in handy sometimes for strategic assaults on enemies or even a little PvP ambush.

Gameplay CONS:  The grind is just bad. At launch it was horrific and after some patching it improved but still; this game really makes you work hard for your levels.  This aspect scared quite a few people away as once you hit around level 25 it becomes terrifying to level.  Flight mechanics are also very unreliable due to clunky controls plus take forever to recharge, making essence gathering a bit time consuming.  Speaking of gathering, exactly why is there a ""success/fail"" bar?  Either I gather my material or I fail... there is no reason why I need to wait there 10 seconds and watch as two bars slowly fill up and cross my fingers that Success beats fail!  Questing becomes a nightmare in parts.  It can go from simple, solo-ish quests to suddenly a mandatory 6 party group to fight elites all for a simple quest worth less experience than killing a few mobs.  Not trying to nit-pick but it can just feel overly grind-ish at times to the point where it is an obvious time sink, not to mention how incredibly grindy combat gets in PvE at times.  The PvP is also a major problem which I will get into below.

GAMEPLAY SUMMARY
+ Skill effects, graphics, fluidity
+ Flight Mechanics add strategy to the mix (mainly PvP focused)
+ Macro system handled professionally and very easy to use.
- Excessive grind
- Clunky flight mechanics
- Questionable gathering / crafting system
- Quest design is poor

** PvP MECHANICS **
This is what AION really is all about. PvPvE.  Pretty  much there is your standard PvP  but also thrown into the mix is the Balaur which serve as AI based combatants that will agro either side.  At any time the Balaur might target your group and swing the tide of battle during your fight or come to aid you before turning their eyes on you.  It is an interest concept that does add some flair to PvP.  While all this does sound good, there are serious problems with the PvP in AION.  It pretty much is a Gankfest.  It comes down to who ganks first, who has the fastest computer etc.  I was in battles that literally were crashing computers(see DESIGN) because of just how graphically intense the game is plus how much is going on.  Sometimes it was almost impossible to capture points simply because everyone would lag up to garbage FPS and the game became unplayable.  The game has no mercy.  If you want to advance you will be forced to PvP and quest in Hostile zones where you will be repeatedly ganked, body camped and have your quest mobs killed. The game is setup that way.

There is no PvE aspect to this game.  YES there are maps in which no PvP can occur; but these areas will not advance you to level cap nor advance the storyline for you. In the end you will be forced to trudge through the PvP infested areas of the game and will be ganked repeatedly.

** GAME DESIGN **
Aion is a visual masterpiece for an MMO.  Graphically it is two steps ahead of any MMO on the market today.  While this is a blessing, it also can be a curse.  This makes Aion fairly graphically intense. Do not let the system requirements fool you.  People with high end SLI rigs have crashed during massive PvP gankfests even when setting graphics to Low.  It is a lot for a PC to take in with so much happening so fast.  However, in a way this is a good thing because it does tell you that PvP can be intense.  It is a war out there and it isn't pretty(in the good sense).  Gear looks incredible. Pump up the graphics and your character just looks amazing. There was a ton of effort put into the character design and gear, even how your wings look.

Class wise, AION handles that by allowing you to select a master class; basic like healer, caster, rogue, warrior.  Complete your ascension and you will be given the choice of two classes, often counters of one another like a DPS Gladiator or the TANKing Guardian.  Once the selection is made you can't undo it so there is no multi-classing.  Skills will be obtained by purchasing skill books every few levels.  At this point it becomes a standard MMO... take quests, kill mobs etc etc. Level up very slowly to get strong and hit cap where you can run dungeons and participate fully in PvP.

** OVERALL **
Not much more I can say.  I've tried AION quite a few times and actually was the last of my friends left playing it.  Everyone tried it in my guild but in the end we all returned to our previous MMO at the time.  It is hard for me to admit that AION is a bad game simply because that is just my Opinion.  What is bad to me might be amazing to another, but seeing as how my entire guild left the game within 3 months might say something about AION's quality.  Even after a year, and Expansion the game has not changed enough to make it enjoyable for me.  The grind, the ganking, the grindy combat;  it is still all there.

With all that I said in mind I give AION 2 stars.  It just doesn't have any long term appeal to me, nor anything that brings enjoyment.  There is no sense of accomplishment either.  It is just  grind.. grind..  However, if you are interested in AION as a possible MMO you should ask around the aion forums for a trial. Players who have enough time into the game can issue trial keys to people to give them some time to try the game out.  Best way to judge a game is to play it yourself in the end ^_^

So, the case needs to be loose enough that you can get the phone in and out without crazy efforts. Unfortunately, getting the phone out of the case is no easy feat. It took a lot of straining and unhappiness.

If that wasn't bad enough, the headphone jack is the most recessed jack I've ever seen on a case. The provided extender is frankly odd looking and if you lose it you're out of luck.

I hope this is the first of better products. I would like to see a more mature product eventually, which I would consider buying.","Disappointing. Didn't work with Pacman, difficult to get phone in and out of case, headphone jack is crazily recessed.",1393459200,2,,

I took a chance and grabbed a Gamecube when I had originally heard about Metroid Prime.  At the time, I had just barely began to accept the concept of First-Person games.  Retro had done a fantastic job of making this game playable, even for those who don't like FPS.  It's actually nice that the second stick isn't needed for aiming, even though nowadays I'm content with dual-stick gaming.  The Gamecube versions of MP1 and MP2 are spectacular.

The level of disappointment of trying to play MP3 with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk was immense.  I tried to force myself to play with this setup several times since I really liked the first two entries.  Aiming manually seems okay at first, but it gets tiresome, especially with how inaccurate the Wii's detection method is.  After using Playstation Move, the Wii's controls are an accuracy nightmare.  So after dealing with the hassle of the proper setup and having to take 10x as long to do simple things such as open doors, I realized I wasn't having fun.  Going back to try MP1 and MP2 with this disastrous control setup only further ruined my adoration for the series.

First of all, this game should have been released for the Gamecube, not Wii. As a matter of fact, the whole game looks like it was completed for Gamecube, then quickly converted to Wii. Let's take when characters shop. The ""Yes"" and ""No"" options are at the bottom of screen. So usually when you point the controller so far down, the sensor bar looses contact with the control, so you have the ""re-aim"" the control several times. This was the design of the previos Gamecube games, but then you could just steer the controlstick and hit ""A"", here you have to aim and choose. This is annoying and frustrating, why couldn't they move the Yes or No to the middle of the screen?! I mean, when you choose what you want to buy, you have three things on the middle of the screen. Then when you've chosen what you want to buy, the options move to the bottom of the screen again - to ask you ""Are you sure you want to buy this?"" - ARGH!!! This was the design of Mario Party 6 and 7, so it's obvious this game WAS done for Gamecube first, then quickly converted. The same problem occours when that character with the hat asks if you want to hear a secret about the board you play, you have to AIM for ""no"".

The minigames also suffers from the quick conversion. A lot of the minigames, you just turn the control to the side, use the plus for steering and 1 to kick/hit and 2 to jump. This is Wii, you'd expect to use the control like in other Wii games, not pretend the control is a Gamecube control!! And those games that use this control are so boring. Other games where you are supposed to steer, you ""tilt"" the controller either left or right. And some other games you turn the control, while it's up, from side to side. Why does the controls have to change so much?? Sometimes it's difficult to get contact with the sensor bar, even when you hold the control like you're supposed to. Take the game with the chimps, the game tells you to steer left or right to move the monkey. The game responds so bad, whether you move the control fast or slow, the chimp takes 2-3 seconds to respond. Bad conversion.
There are a very few games which really feel like you play on Wii, like the ""Shaking Soda can"" minigame, or the ""Clean Chomp"" game. There's also a game where you should do 3 different things - saw, hammer and paint a wall. These games are easy and may seem boring, but they are funniest because you get to do something with the Wii remote, it feels like you are really playing. But believe me, the boring minigames are overload and they are regurlarly chosen instead of the fun minigames. I also felt the ""Battle Minigames"" were all boring, one game is impossible to be the only winner, because there's a limit on how much points you can get. And I HATE the cutting ropes game. It's totally random and I've never won it.

It gets worse. In previous Mario Party games, especially in the first Mario Party, the easy computer players were so bad you were laughing at how badly they played certain games. I remember in the first game, I was laughing so hard watching Luigi play a memory game, he would run to the correct place, but then change direction and go to another place, then another, and another and choose wrong. Talk about stupid! In this game, I felt the easy players weren't easy, they play rather good for being supposed to suck at the game. So because they are easy, they play good at a slow speed or if the games requires a certain distance, they fail at certain distances. In previous games, easy computers was a laugh, here they appear really good.

Anyway, let's say you play a game with a friend, you are forced to use 2 computers. You use them on easy, they never win a single minigame. That would make you a winner right? Wrong. This game is purely luck and walking fast. The computer players always hit 5-10, they land on all the bonus places and they can get 20-50 coins on a single turn. There is also a secret star area, when you hit a golden space, you get transported there. Me and a family member played this game, Toad was a computer player. Within 2 turns, he had already gone to the secret area. Then he went there TWO TIMES MORE. And yourself usually get to the secret area 1 out of 5 times playing a whole board game. So at the end, he got over 6 stars within 5 turns. That's just impossible to prevent, there is no chance time and duel only let's you steal 1-20 coins (I've only seen stars as a choice twice). So basically, the computer players never win a single minigame, but are so lucky they get coins and stars all the time.

It gets EVEN worse. The boards feel uncreative and slow. The only way you get starts if you are quick enough, that means hitting 5-10 all the time. This what the computer players do. This is not what you do. Yourself get 1-4, if you're really lucky you get 10. I mean, sometimes I get 1 several times in a row and the computer player is almost at the star. To sum all the boards up
Donkey Kong: Star is far away, so get there quickly
Goomba: Star is very far away, it's also free, so you just gotta get there quickly.
Shy Guy Train: Star is far away, costs 10 (or 20?), get there Q U I C K L Y
Koopa Town: Only board worth it, you put money into hotels to be the owner. You don't need to be quick here.
Boo's Mansion: Get QIUCKLY to Boo to get a star for 10 coins.
It's all about walking fast, since you get so much money from bonuses, you don't NEED the minigame money. Basically, I can have 70 coins, but I only hit 1-3, then I don't have much to use the coins for, because I can't buy stars or candy if I don't QUICKLY get there.
The 1 player Star Battle was pure torture, it was all about luck to win against the computer players.

Another problem with this game is that there is a lot of dialogue and scenes you can't skip. Especially when the last 5 turns are announced, I button mash the A button like crazy, but each text box takes 1-2 to get rid of. Then it takes 1-3 seconds to show each player, then MORE dialogue. It takes 1-2 minutes just to get through this scene.
And on the board, especially when you walk on the golden space, sometimes you need to be transported. You sit in a car and get driven to the place you need to go. It takes like 30 seconds to a minute to get there. And you CANNOT skip it. This slows the game down so bad!

This game is only fun when you play with 3 friends, and even then the game can be boring. You can only win this game is you are lucky. Out of 20 times playing, I've won 2 times. I just don't bother doing my best anymore, because I know I'm going to loose anyway, just because I'm so unlucky in this game.

One last warning, do not buy the thing that allows you to tease your opponents in the ""Fun Zone"". You CANNOT turn this off, so everytime you move your control the characters starts making the same sounds over and over. Even if you just move the control to put the control somewhere, the characters starts talking. For example, Peach can say ""I am the princess"" and ""Bleeeh!"". She says ""I am the princess"" 1 time out of 50. So when you move the control, just slightly, she goes ""Bleeh!"".

The story is still short and linear but the loot has been improved tremendously.  The weapons are better (I have Legendary items from pre v2.0 that have worse stats than the rares I get now) and the armor and weapons you get are more tuned for your character. In the past I kept getting items for other characters all the time.  Now that's a rarity.  One other major improvement is I no longer have the jerky, stuttering movement that I had in the past.  I'm guessing it's because Blizzard moved all the calculations to my computer instead of the servers.  Diablo 3 never needed to be an online game, that was just the excuse Blizzard used to promote the garbage Auction House that is now gone for good.  We still have multiplayer, though, so bring your friends.  Also, you can now choose what difficulty you want upfront.  No more being forced to play easy mode.

Original Review:

The hype was strong and I almost bought this on day one because I love hack-n-slash RPG's.  No sense bringing up the mess that was Blizzard's attempt at forcing us to play a *single-player game* over an always-online connection.  Even now (patch 1.05 as of the time of this review) I experienced stuttering movement and other latency issues.  Plus, there's nothing like starting up a solo game and finding out you can't play because the remote servers are down (yes, it still happens.)  It's so annoying that I will never pay full price for any ""always on"" requirement and I hope others will do the same.

As far as D3 the game is concerned, there are three things I think Blizzard has done better than the competition.  First, the art style is incredibly well done with unique, detailed environments.  Secondly, the level design is excellent.  So many times I tried to game the system by making my way down paths I believed would take me directly to a dungeon exit.  Instead, I found myself consistently fooled into clearing out the entire level before I was able to progress in the story.  Finally, unlike nearly every RPG to date, your companions are both intelligent and useful.  You actually want them around when the battles get difficult.

Unfortunately, these positives can't save the fact that the game is very short.  My character completed the story in 25 hours and I like exploring areas searching for hidden treasures and secret dungeons.  If you played the game straight through and avoided the side quests, you could probably complete it in under 20 hours.  In addition, I was only able to make it to level 32 before the game was finished.  Since the level cap is 60, I'll need to play through the story a second time just to unlock all of my available skills.  Speaking of which, you have no choice what difficulty level to play.  The game forces you to play ""normal"" difficulty (which is actually quite easy) before you can play the next highest difficulty level.  The quests are remarkably standard and while crafting was available, we were locked out of using items we crafted unless we hit an arbitrary level.  Starting to get the picture?  Instead of being given the freedom to go where you want and do what you want, Diablo 3 holds your hand and tells you what you can and cannot do.  It's so linear that it's like playing the single-player campaign of a FPS except in third-person view.

Fortunately, I purchased this game at a major discount but I would have been upset like many of the other reviewers if I paid full price.  Since you're only getting half a game, I would recommend purchasing this at half price and that's only if you're a big fan of the genre.  Just don't forget you'll have to go through the hassle of signing up for an online account as if you were playing a MMO.  If you're not a fan of the genre, avoid this game altogether.  Blizzard is asking too much and providing too little.  A much more enjoyable, and less expensive alternative is Torchlight II.","Beautiful, linear, and much too short",1351814400,9,{'Format:': ' Computer Game'},

The Demo gives you quote ""35 square miles"" of area to play with so it should be a good indication of what the full game would be like.

As another reviewer stated, the voice acting and dialogue is terrible.  There were three of us taking turns with the demo and we would break out into gut busting laughter all at the same time with this cheesy stuff.  It wasn't funny intentionally like the banter of Ellis in Left 4 Dead 2, it was just bad production funny.  The character animation is also funny to watch; again,funny without trying to be.

The action is ridiculously over the top.  The protagonist flies around like Batman/Spiderman with guns.  It was a lot of fun for a few minutes, but it got old really fast.  As far as being over the top and silly, this game can be compared to the Three Stooges in my opinion,  I like the Three Stooges, but can only take them in small doses.  After sitting through a half hour short, I've had enough for awhile.  Some people can sit through a Three Stooges marathon, but it's not for me.

I had fun with the demo, but I am glad I downloaded it before I bought the game.  There's enough there for me to get my 30 minute ludicrous fix without having to spend any money.

After EA bought the exclusive rights to the NFL games, I was rather peeved.  Madden 2007 for the PS3 just enforces the reasons for my dismay.

Pros:

- NFL foolball

- Improved graphics from the previous generation of video game consoles (not by the leaps and bounds you'd expect though)

-  That's about it

Cons:

- Graphics not up to the quality you'd expect from next gen technology.

- Controls feel 'off', especially on defense.

- change of the speed burst button from X to R2...this was very difficult to get used to.

- create-a-player was ruined.  Yeah, it was kind of cheap to be able to build the perfect player.  Now you have to participate in drills to set your created player's attributes.  While fine in theory, the drills (think scounting combine...bench press, 40yd dash, etc) weren't well executed.  I really noticed the 'off' feel of the controls while running through a tackling drill with a LB.  It was the same setup as the Mini-Camp drill from previous games (which I normally ruled at), but I could barely make a tackle.  The players just didn't feel responsive.

Bottom line, this game felt rushed.  I had a feeling EA would let the quality of their NFL game slip now that there's no competition.  I can't even recommend renting this game, let alone buying it.

Units Cap is the biggest disappointment. Player cannot even build medium armies. For example: while playing high tech GDI Support Class, I could build only 2 Kodiaks, 3 Thunderheads and 3 or 4 engineers. As a result, I had only 5 combat units and could not train anything else because of ""Inssuficient Command Points"".
In Tiberian Twilight I don't feel like playing RTS, but rather like some Massive Multiplayer RPG. Previously, I enjoyed having a choice of making massive armies or smaller high-tech groups of units. At the same time, I could construct flanking or hidden strike forces. In CnC 4, there is no such a choice because of units cap.

I don't like ""capture the flag"" gameplay. This mode is well known from games like ""World in Conflict"", and there is nothing innovative about it. Worse, this is only one game mode in Tiberian Twilight and it fails in 1 vs 1 skirmishes. I always prefered good 1v1 RTS online, so I can't enjoy CnC4.

I remember my disappointment when saw cartoony universe of RedAlert3. I thought, it was because Red Alert suppose to be like that and it never gonna happen to tiberium world. I was wrong. Although some units are cool, majority of them look like toys.
Moreover, pink and purple lasers and bullets, colorful and shiny tanks and oversized infantry make it look just as cartoony as Red Alert3. It simply does not fit to dark atmosphere of Tiberium universe.

Finally, I can't believe, developers got rid of Scrin as playable faction.

CnC4 game is not a total disaster. Tradition of various choice of units(although ruined by units cap) with plenty of interesting and innovative abilities and upgrades survived. There is still a lot of room for micro, even with such a tiny armies. Moreover, when all players skillfully cooperate, game becomes fun.

The problem with the leg strap is that whoever engineered the design had no business doing so. I'm not terribly out of shape and my legs are the normal ""circumfrence"". However, when I put this leg strap onto ANY sort of clothing/fabric, it always slipped down during the exercises. I tried running shorts, jogging pants, jeans, casual shorts, anything and everything that would just stop the damned thing from slipping. NOTHING worked. It always slips and you can feel it slipping and it makes you really distracted from the exercise which is TERRIBLE for a good, focused workout. I highly reccomend waiting until they possibly improve the leg strap.

Also, the mechanics of the game are TERRIBLY flawed. On several of the exercises, I was doing EXACTLY what was asked of me by the game, but the trainer kept insisting that I wasn't doing it right and implored me to try again REPEATEDLY ad nauseum. You will become so frustrated that, if you're anything like me, you'll end up screaming to the TV ""BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOING, YOU PIECE OF..."" Well you get it.

The most difficult workouts to deal with are any of the ones involving lunges. It NEVER picks up on your movements, and then blames YOU for it.

I did not like the game therefore I am rightly entitled to MY opinion on it. I bought the bundled package yesterday, wanted to really play the game. So after downloading it and playing for about 2 hours, the servers go down. And still are not 100% up today. I find this unacceptable. The graphics are ok, crisp, clear, but with some jagged edges and blurs that harken back to last generation consoles. I have noticed all the 1 star reviews have been deleted by Amazon, in order to boost sales, and not let good old Microsoft down. Well guess what? Tough %%%%!!

The game has it's fun moments, wall running, jumping with the jetpack in the air to take down a titan or soldier is great fun. But after a while you think wow I payed 60 dollars, or got the console JUST for this. Which I was ready to purchase Forza 5 and Dead rising as well. Well suffice to say I won't be purchasing anything from them. I took back the system, period. Especially when the servers went down, and the excuses started.

Also having 6 vs 6 is not that much fun, people are easy to hunt down, I want more challenge, free for all, a single player campaign that doesn't require the net. In case it goes down (again). So this game is/was overhyped, but I think the true gamers know there are a lot better games with much better substance out there. I've never in my life seen something like this, just to boost sales, and popularity for a product. Take it down as much as you want, I'll just keep posting it back.

Pros
Accurate controls, unless your in the air, then it's tough
The learning curve is pretty easy, but not overly so.
The Titans are loads of fun, especially to pull out the pilot of your rival, and toss him away.
Environments are rich.
Very fast paced, so if you have epilepsy, best play something slower.

Cons
Server keeps crashing, even today.
Graphics are ok, barely looks next gen.
Frame rates can drop dramatically, making it very hard to play. (I have a 50mb connection with boosts to 70mb) btw.
Overall it's just another innovative shooter that has been glorified because of poor console sales. Period.

I've replaced it with an original charge kit made by Microsoft so I will mention some of the differences below.  It's important to note that this generic charge kit worked from the very first day I bought it. It did what it was supposed to do, which was charge my 360 battery while I was playing, real simple stuff.

So, why did it break after 8 months?  It came down to 3 weaknesses that become apparent when compared to Microsoft's version.

1-The plastic around the USB is noticeably cheaper, it has a flex to it that just doesn't feel right.
2-The cord measures 6 ft., compared to the 9 ft. of the Microsoft.
3-The fit into the usb port has a little more up and down/side to side wiggle than the Microsoft version.

After 8 months of tugging against the USB port, the soldered connectors on the USB finally tore. At 5 dollars, I'd say 8 month's of use is actually pretty good.

So the product worked, why am I rating 2 stars?  Well, would I recommend this product today?  No.  Right now at least the Microsoft version charge kit has dropped so much in price that for a few dollars you get better quality and an extra 360 battery.  Save yourself revisiting the issue in another year and just get the original version.",I'd say 8 month's of use is actually pretty good.

But since I am a big fan of this game series since its start back in 2008, I thought it would be unfair for UBISOFT to continue ruining this game. And here is why this game deserves even less than 2 stars:

1- The new combat system is not dynamic and out of control. You cannot really manage killing opponents the way you really want to. Switching among whomever you're fighting is a nightmare and killing them is just a coincidence or just a rush experience every time, I would call it. I remember that this was the most fun part of the game, that you have full control on how to grab and kill enemies.

2. The game is too big and its environment is nice but mission and side mission are scattered all over the huge map. There is no solid, good story in it. Every mission is isolated. So you keep loading and loading every time you start something - you reach your destination, then the game loads that mission or scenario for you, then you finish it, and move to the next. This is not fun and boring. It is like you're playing small, small games within one big game. There is no continuity nor suspense. Missions are too easy and never challenging but rather short and boring.

3. I don't see much difference between the skills of the two characters nor special abilities that really matter. Only the appearance and the stupid bazaar canvases and outfits that you spend your money on buying which add no value or whatsoever.

4- I did not enjoy the game because I felt that it is very repetitive and isolated. The story-line is weak and boring. Even characters are all look alike. it is like 10 years old game. That's a shame!

I do not really recommend this game to anyone. BORING! BORING! BORING!",BORING!,1499558400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
405848,2.0,True,"10 8, 2015",A3URVWPFJOHT72,B00Z9HS664,zlionsfan,"Once again, the lesson is NEVER PREORDER. As much as I wanted to show Harmonix that there really is an audience for this much-awaited sequel, all I ended up doing was reassuring them that they could release a half-finished product that in no way is a worthy sequel to 3. Even if you managed to get the right instruments (I did), there's no guarantee they're working properly, and while they do support the automatic sync that the later instruments for 3 introduced, you're still probably going to deal with lag, which means playing on Hard or Expert is not going to work well.

Of course you'll have to play the standard songs because your DLC won't all transfer yet, even if you want to take the time to download every song individually (confirming that the Xbox Live Marketplace is just as terrible on the Bone as it is on the 360), a large percentage of them won't show up as previously purchased. Harmonix is at least admitting there's a problem now - on launch day it was ""contact Microsoft or Sony."" Right. I'm sure I'm the only customer who got 25% of his DLC licenses transferred.

If Harmonix can get all of these problems worked out - and unlike Neversoft, they have a history of doing so - then I might get this out and play it again. Until then, it was a waste of my money, and it'll be a waste of yours too.

UPDATE: Here we are, months later, and it turns out that Harmonix did manage to get a few problems sorted ... but there are others they never really did get to. Most of my DLC seems to have transferred, but of course not all songs are available due to what I'm guessing is the inability to retain licenses for them. (Not that there's any place to find this out.)

The game itself isn't bad, and at its best, it does address a couple of the glaring weaknesses with RB3: you're not nearly as encumbered by sets entirely from in-game music (the new feature that lets you vote on what to include is cool), and the career mode is significantly longer. However, it introduces a number of other issues, many of which came down to releasing 50% of a game at full price and then gradually adding features as time went along.

There's also the problem on the Xbone version that combines Microsoft's Apple-like quest to make you replace everything every time and Harmonix' puzzling decision to allow PDP to release only a small amount of adapters for those of us with ION Drum Rockers for the 360. Because the standard drums are garbage (especially with the cymbals attached - those are even cheaper than the drums), your only option now is to stock up on drum kits so that when one of them breaks you can just throw it away and open the next one.

Overall, I'm really regretting my decision to buy it for the Xbone; I didn't really get enough carryover value to justify that purchase, and it doesn't seem like Harmonix is really invested in supporting my part of their customer base. It's too bad, because at its best, the Rock Band series was amazing.

2.  You cannot save DURING a mission, so if you get bored with trying the same jump over and over, you will have to go back to the beginning of the mission if you don;t want to leave your XBOX running all night.

It is after all just 50 dollars more (for the WIFI) than the competition which when you compare specs, is so much more for just that little bit extra. I knew it was a bit too good to be true though as there are strings attached...namely the memory cards. In fact in my mind that's the biggest draw on the whole Vita sales debacle. Sony wants to invite buyers in with a wonderful price tag then rope you up with this money gouging proprietary memory and frankly, not a whole lot of people are buying into it...or buying it at all rather! But if you really want the PS Vita and you really can't wait for anything cheaper to come along, your stuck with the Vita memory with no real workarounds. The second biggest problem is the size of these cards in general. 4 GB is useless as most full digital Vita games will wipe such a card out. If your buying nothing but physical retail Vita games and doing nothing else, I'd direct you to the 8 GB card. 16 GB is the minimum for anyone wishing to do anything remotely serious on their Vita. If your heavy into PS One classics, PSP, and Vita digital downloads, 32 GB is a must and even then this may not be enough for some people. They really need to come off these prices and offer a 64 GB solution (hello 2013!). As for the read/write speeds of this thing, I'm no memory card expert but I have quite a few different formats lying around my house and I'd say that Vita memory reads/writes no faster than your standard class 4 SD memory card. By the way these things are tiny so be careful when using them and make sure if you invest in multiple cards that you store them away where they can't be lost so easily. The Vita game card cases are pretty cheap and offer a slot for securing Vita memory.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PlayStation-Vita-Card-Case/dp/B006JKARPS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PlayStation Vita Card Case</a>

All too quickly, I began to see the game for what it really was; a shell of what a good game could be.

Rise of the Dark Spark is a side-story that bridges the fourth film and the War/Fall of Cybertron games together. You'll see early on where the world collide, with some more-classic designs mixing it up with the Michael Bay abominations and a plot that doesn't seem to go anywhere. Even if you have deep knowledge of the previous games, you still may find yourself at a loss for what exactly is going on as the game jumps from character to character, faction to faction. Multiplayer is simply a hoard mode, where waves of enemies swarm you and up to 3 other players online... But good luck finding anyone at this point. It is perhaps the greatest shame that co-op, a feature that can save even the most mediocre of games, has no community after a year in the wild. In all, RotDS is a weird game-movie hybrid that doesn't seem to fit in any of the previous media nicely, but rather seems jammed in to meet a cross-promo deadline.

As a PS4 game goes, despite what some people have said in other reviews, the game looks terrible. If you crave sloppy, last-gen graphics, then by all means, dig in. The gameplay isn't all that engaging, opting for a run and gun style with some cumbersome controls thrown in for good measure. No part of this game feels cohesive of well thought out, which often happens when you give competent developers an unrealistic deadline.

Even at $10-15, RotDS is not worth your time. For long-time Transformers fans looking for one more platinum trophy to tackle, you can still do better than this game.",Sparked my interest and left me in a dark place,1444780800,2,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'},

It was a revolutionary game because it was released for the nascent CD-ROM drive and the rest was history. Back then, the graphics, especially the ambience, were awesome, and there was nothing like it before.

Now, the game is dated and frustrating to play. It's not noticeable until the Bishop game. By now, the flow of trying to solve a puzzle is constantly interrupted by Stauf's voice-overs. Because of this, some of the puzzles are needlessly dragged out.

Only two puzzles (Bishop and Blocks) are almost impossible to solve with the third (the dreaded Microscope) being virtually impossible to overcome. The first two, I've had to use the walkthrough to move past them, but the third, I distinctly remember beating it in 1993. But the story is that the computer ran on a 386/486 processing speed which made the AI easier to beat. Now, the CPU speed is too fast which makes the AI incredibly smarter than before and thus impossible to beat because it can think ahead of many possible moves. It's all mathematically coded. The fourth puzzle (Piano) has nearly driven me out of my mind because it's too freakingly long. It needs to be limited to 10 moves, and that's it.

Those puzzles are why the game can be a pain in the ass. Not a lot of people are capable of solving such puzzles given the difficulty of them, and it's incredibly unfair for them to be presented with these challenges. Walking around the house is also frustrating experience; it's too rigid and does not allow for any flexibility. Hit the wrong button, and I am transported into a secret portal, wasting my time navigating myself through the way all over again. Saving the game is a pain because it takes you back from the beginning of the floor, not to where you were just at prior to the save.

The story makes no sense, and the acting is incredibly poor. That's why they stopped making FMV games not too long afterwards. None of the scenes in the game can be skipped. They must be endured to the end which make the game boring to play. That's why it took me 3 days to get through it.

All in all, The 7th Guest is one of those nostalgic games that I wish I never picked up.

Stellar graphics, seemless transition from movie to game, imaginative level design, excellent two player strategy, a level system for special attacks, etc.  Therefore, I was excited to play Prince Caspian.

I think there are a few things that ruin this game.  First is it not being linear.  Each level is open-ended.  Each stage is broken down into different areas that are re-accessible over and over again.  Items re-appear and you are asked with a prompt if you'd like to re-do the area.  I don't know who thought that would be a good idea.

Second, most of the game is just finding the missing lever so that you can re-attach it to the crank.  There is an over-abundance of crank pulling, which takes 5 seconds or more of button mashing to complete.

Third, there are no special attacks. In the first game you were allowed to level up and earn special attacks.  Characters now are limited to three attacks or less, with very little variation. Lucy cannot even use her cordial to heal, Susan does not use the pan flute or the horn, etc.

Fourth, there are 20 or more playable characters in this game.  You cannot choose the character you want at any given time, but are limited to whatever characters they give you in each stage. Maybe it's just me, but I'd rather play as the main characters and not as a tree, centaur, or Caspian's tutor.

Fifth, Huge Battles play out in the background.  They are just eye candy.  You can stand in the middle of a huge battleground and never be hurt.  The game is easy.  Involving button mashing to get through.

Sixth, missions are boring.  More crank turning and many  things in the game were not in the movie at all.

Seventh - The first game featured cast interviews and other interesting extras and movies.  This game lacks in that department.

The problem with this game was that there wasn't much to the movie or the book, so they didn't have much to work with in the first place; however, it could have still been a great game, if it played like the first.

I'm a big fan of the Chronicles of Narnia, but this game is nothing more than button mashing, crank turning, and major character hopping with characters I had no desire to be.  I recommend the first Narnia game over this one any day.

The game was not optimized to play on the PSP before release. As a result sometimes the game would freeze for a second or two during the action, very annoying and very frequent. This happens in game and sometimes in cutscenes.

The worst offender of this game is the camera. In this game, the apprentice moves fast as he fights, unfortuanely the camera does not move that fast.  Turning to face a new enemy on your side or back is frustrating. Fighting a boss is going to get you dizzy as the camera is pointing away from the action half of the time.

Another minor gripe, are the cutscenes. They are oh so cheap. cutscenes that are well rendered can help you connect with emotions. But not here. Faces are so bland.

I am not going to wast internet space describing the gameplay. It is not worthy to go farther in the review.

This games tries to emulate the God of War formula but it just fails at everything. If you played the GOW game in the PSP, then skip this title because it just won't capture the same greatness of that game.

137477,2.0,False,"06 4, 2010",A33DZPE5V6FCR4,B0016G88RO,Schwe1nehund,"Spy games don't come along too often, so when I heard that Obsidian was developing a spy RPG, I was fairly excited. At the same time, I was also a little weary. I used to LOVE the talent behind Obsidian. This, after all, is a studio formed by many of the top talent that formerly worked at Interplay and the much-venerated Black Isle Studios. Between 9 and 12 years ago, I went through some of the best gaming experiences thanks to the original Fallout games, Planescape: Torment and Icewind Dale. Despite this rich history, starting with Star Wars: KOTOR II Obsidian's products have become progressively worse. KOTOR II had a great story but was mired by several bugs and, well...depending on how you made certain choices, large chunks of the story towards the endgame unfolded without a shred of logic. Then they delivered Neverwinter Nights 2, which again had everything going for it, except for some horrendous bugs. At least one bug was game-breaking.

It is the same story with Alpha Protocol. While the plot is serviceable, and the dialogue system is fairly engaging, the rest of the game leaves much to be desired. Graphics, character models and animations are clunky and laughable. From the very first trailer, the game looked long in the teeth. What is shocking is the fact that they used the Unreal 3.0 engine and still botched it up. No its not the best engine out there (*kaff* Crytek *kaff*), but its capable of building some pretty nifty looking worlds.

The sound is very average. Personally I've heard worse voice acting, especially in some of the European imports. The music fits the mood (some plain Bond/Bourne rip-offs) but doesn't have much character.

Gameplay is mostly bad, but there are a few bright spots. The gunplay is wonky - and is particularly frustrating if you, like myself, spent a couple of months earlier this year with Commander Shepard and Co. Mini-games like hacking get old fast, but that's a complaint I have about mini-games in a lot of RPGs. Surprisingly I like the time-limit in the dialogue choices. It really makes you feel like you are a spy under pressure and its quite a thrill to decide someone's fate in the space of 5 seconds. I also like the weapons/skill customization - which is fleshed out properly enough.

A glaring hole is the (non-existent) artificial intelligence. My favorite bug is when baddies keep on climbing up and down the same ladder for no reason whatsoever.

As far as plot goes...its okay. But then again story has never been Obsidian's weakness. I can see two reasons why Alpha Protocol turned out the way it did. One: Obsidian just wanted to shove this out the door when they inked the deal to develop Fallout New Vegas. And two: They just don't have a good game development process in place. Which is a pity, given the good writers on staff.

I hope Obsidian is taking note as I am certainly not the only individual feeling this way. After this mess, I doubt I'll blindly go out and buy Fallout New Vegas - original developers or no (I am so bloody scared about how it turns out!) From now on, Obsidian is going to have to work hard to get my hard-earned money.

My advice to prospective buyers: wait till the game hits the sub $30 mark - give it 6 to 12 months. Actually you are better of re-visiting an old RPG like The Witcher or something.

Luckily, the other two games I acquired were Rock Band 2 and Fallout 3.  I say luckily, because with Midnight Club, I basically got what I paid for.

I'm not going to go into a lot of detail here because there isn't a lot of game to detail.  Midnight Club really set the bar high with DUB Edition in terms of vehicle customization.  It set the bar slightly higher with LA.  No other game comes close to the level of customization allowed by Midnight Club.  We're talking little things, like the license plates of every state in the US, and the ability to raise and lower convertible tops WHILE driving - as in, you don't have to pause and access menu options, or return to the ""garage,"" etc.

Unfortunately, that is the best part of Midnight Club LA.  And believe me - I tried to like it.  I went into the options and created custom control layouts...  Of course, you can only do this for manual shifting - you have to use a preset for automatic driving...  Why??  I mean I love manual shifting - in games that have realistic driving physics like Forza or Gran Turismo.  MC:LA is another one of those games that blips the throttle to try and generate ""movie-style"" sound effects.  You never do that in a real car.  So when you try to drive manually, it just... ...sucks.

Of course these games are also built to favor drifting.  But the drifting is terrible.  My little front-wheel drive car drifts forEVER...  I can't stop the drift and it forces me to take ever-widening corners just to compensate for how long the car will slide.  This causes me to get passed by the AI opponents.

And you'll get passed a lot because of the rubber banding.  You'll get to first place quickly, but you'll never stay there.  Fall behind, and the other cars make more mistakes.  Pull ahead, and they become impeccable drivers.  And as you acquire better cars and better parts, it'll eventually get to the point that you can't win anything anymore.  The difficulty ramps up so high that it becomes unplayable.  Opponents simply ""level up"" with you, using better cars with better parts.  Essentially, buying better cars is useless.  All you're doing is keeping up with the curve.

The driving physics - as already touched upon above - are simply terrible.  Cars don't act like real cars act.  And believe me - I know how real cars act.  This review is written by the proud owner of a Dodge Viper GTS coupe.  I've been on tracks, I've raced competitively.  Midnight Club is an arcade game, and nothing from MC:LA translates correctly into the real world.  Your car will bounce off of some impacts with other vehicles or walls.  Other impacts - more severe ones - launch you into a unwelcomed cut-scene which shows your car spinning out of control and always - and I do mean always - ending up 180 degrees from your original direction of travel.  I don't think it's chance - I think this sequence is intentionally used to pivot your car around as some sort of punishment for hitting another car.  It becomes insanely frustrating, and often results in me deciding to play something else.

Midnight Club gives us the ability to create one-of-a-kind automobiles that would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in the real world.  But once you've built that car, you really won't have any interest in driving it.

If you're a kid who thought the ""Fast & Furious"" movies were ""totally awesome,"" then you'll love Midnight Club.

DIABLO 3 COME SOON AND SAVE US ALL!

Starcraft 2 has been out for a few months now and I'm bored out of my mind playing it, melee and custom. I remember playing Starcraft 1 and how I was totally addicted to everything. I spent most of my high school youth (sad as that sounds) playing this and Diablo. I'm in custom games for SC2 and the only thing I can really find are a bunch of tower defense or mass spawning games like Nexus Wars (there are tons of similar games as well). I've been waiting FOREVER for Firebat Tag or some sort of fun tag game and I'm guessing no one is going to come up with one till maybe a year or two from now. I also thought that maybe this feeling was just me, but the proof is also in my friends list. I have over 40 people in my friends list and when this game started and a month or two in, 20-30 of them were on a lot. A month or so of not playing and I come back and now I only have 2-5 people on, which has been so for almost two weeks now.

So I've sort of given up on Starcraft 2. Maybe another year or two and hopefully they will fix the following below and there will be a lot better custom games available. Overall, SC2 died because it was overhyped, over a dozen years in the making, and it's practically the same in many areas and worse where it counts. I was expecting A LOT more. I'm sad that Blizzard, a company that usually has a great reputation for making highly successful games, have failed on one of my favorite types of MMOs.

Let's all hope they don't murder Diablo 3 as well.

I have pretty much the same complaints as the majority, including some of my own personal feuds with it.

1. Can't change usernames - you can change it now but it took months and should have been something available at the very beginning. They should have also said in clear, over-sized fonts that the name chosen would be your final. Now you can change it once for free, but pay for it afterwards. Thanks blizzard.....

I was basically running around for a few months now with the lame username of Zerg. I made it because I thought I'd get a rare original name and that I could make multiple usernames. Fortunately for me though, some people still think there's such a thing as an original name so I get to gloat once in awhile. ""Yeah, I have the rarest name in the world, ENVY MEEEEE!""

2. No original names - So if you have a name, a ton of other people have it. Not to mention you can't even add numbers to your names, which kills the thought of originality even more.

3. Clan Tags - Still don't see it available.

4. No Chatrooms - this is one of the biggest issues to me because other than playing games, I would also use it to socialize with my gaming friends. Chatrooms and private chatrooms help people organize games they want to play with each other and so on.

5. Personalize game names and Party and Invite System - Before in SC1, you can tell your friends the game name you wanted and they can copy and paste it into the search and be in there. Now you got to party up or invite one by one. I don't like to party up because if one person doesn't accept the game you want, you sort of have to wait and I'm not sure if they fixed this yet, but if you go into a game that has separate teams like a 1v1v1v1 kind of game like a custom game, you can't really join because being in the same party, the party system only works for games that'll let you be on the same team.... I understand the use of the new organization system, but I would like the option to revert to customized game names as well...

6. Backstabbing is now replaced by a custom game called Phantom which I find is nowhere as fun. Backstabbing should be left as it was in the first one because it gives the feeling of real battle, where there's more randomness and unpredictability. In phantom, you already know there's a backstabber. I don't want that, I just want it the way it was, where you play a game like computer stomping or even just melee and thinking everything is great and then it happens.

7. I don't really like how you can't run between stuff like pylons with my probe. This is a personal thing, but I like being able to run between certain closely built buildings, it's very useful for custom tag games.

8. Profile icons look like crap. They look neat blown up, but when people join games, it looks like trash. Like one person would have this icon that I really thought was barf. Most of them look too small and the details so hard to see that earning them seems not so much of a reward.

The deadzone on this controller is atrocious. I tested this with games that have 0% software deadzone. You lose over 25% of the beginning stick-movement because movements don't register.

Graphics:  I really could care less about graphics but I know it is a major selling point for some gamers.  Too Human has beautiful ""large"" environments.  I say ""large"" because the levels seem huge, with backgrounds that go on for days but you are basically confined to halway size paths that you run through and repetively slash at enemies.

Character equipment designs are gorgeous.  Facial textures look laughable on some characters though.  Mainly Baldur himself.

Sound:  Sound along with equipment design are the only 2 stars I will give this game.  The musical score is good and so are the sound effects.

Controls: The right-thumbstick controls are controversial.  I see what the designers were trying to do and in fact the combat controls seem to work, however a totally broken lock on system breaks the controls.  You will litteraly have a GIANT 2 feet in front of you.  Tilt the thumbstick in front of you and there's a good chance you will forego this behemoth to target some random midget that is minding his own business 600ft away.  This is inexcusable. This problem is compounded with a horrible camera system.  Forget about using the default camera and pull back to ISO mode. Even ISO mode, however, cannot save you from camera seizures that happen when you try to turn a corner or even turn a 180.

Gameplay: Ok this is where I could rant forever but I will try to be brief.

- Game is made of only 4 ungodly massive levels.

- Combat is broken by the camera and lock-on system

- Character classes are totally unbalanced.  Certain classes are dying machines.  Imagine playing an MMO, where every class has a purpose in a team concept but there is no team, only you (maybe one friend online)

- Speaking of online, it is broken as well.  The enemies level to the highest lvl character in the group. So.. I got my game a week before my friend.  I reached level 35 he was lvl 15.  We figured the game would find a happy medium to scale the baddies to. WRONG!!  Every creature was lvl 38+. Resulting in my friend dying every 2 secs.

- Pointlessly boring cyberspace quests.

- Bosses have way too much health( GARN especially)

Story:  The story is pretty bland with bad voice acting and dialogue.

+ For choosing Norse mythology instead of Greek or something else that's been run into the ground.

- For choosing Baldur as the main character when you have Thor and Tyr as supporting characters.  Baldur is so sissified that his mother had to beg everything in creation not to kill her son but he ends up dying at the hands of the only thing she thought harmless enough not to ask.... MISTLETOE.  :(

- The story could be compeling but nothing is explained.  The designers must have figured that Norse mythology is the #1 religion in the world and everyone knows it like the back of their hands.  Nothing is explained only refered to.  Characters are introduced with little to know backstory.  The story in this game basically sucks because of presentation.

So on a final note, there is a lot of complaining about the death scene.  It is there to mask the loading/game over screen you would see in any other game.  I actually think this is a good idea.  The bad part of it is that  you will die so many times in this broken game that you will see the valkyrie animation 100+ times.

226865,2.0,True,"11 19, 2013",A2OUKHGJ85XN4U,B003YC4D9A,Charles H.,"The first and most important to thing to note is that this product is not produced by Nintendo. I would count myself as being somewhat savvy about noticing such things, and yet, I fell for it! lol. If you look at the manufacturers of this product listing, it says, ""By: Generic."" So, keep that in mind. I bought this so I would have a second controller for multiplayer games like Goldeneye, and it does not at all measure up to the standard set by Nintendo's excellent Classic Controller Pro.

Having said that, just because it's a third party doesn't mean it's a bad controller. Sometimes, third party controllers are the best controllers you can get for a system (see also: the N64). But this controller is pretty bad when compared to the Classic Controller that's manufactured by Nintendo. There are a several noticeable problems:

Of primary concern is the wire that goes into the Wii Remote. It is not firmly attached into the insides of the controller. Not long after using the thing for the first time, the black wire came out a little and exposed the controller's internal wiring. That's actually a small safety risk, so keep that in mind if you intend to let your children use this device.

Of secondary concern is the fact that it's pretty crummy when it comes to actually controlling video games. The analog sensitivity is too high. In some games you can adjust this, but in most games, you cannot. To make things worse, something has actually changed inside of the controller over time, and now the analog sensitivity is just absurdly high.

So maybe it just sucks for 3D games, right? Maybe it'll be better for 2D games like A Link to the Past? How could they screw that up? I don't know, but they did. The D-pad is very stiff, and you just can't count on it for 2D games that require very quick movements like Pokemon Puzzle League.

For those of you with softmodded Wiis, this will be important: This controller is essentially unusable with the Homebrew Channel. There's a response time delay even while just browsing the menus, so you definitely cannot count on it for playing Homebrew games.

In short, spent the extra money and get a Classic Controller Pro from Nintendo. If you're going to buy it from a place such as Amazon, make sure the listing says that it's manufactured by Nintendo.","Usable, but steer clear of it.",1384819200,,,

290184,2.0,False,"10 20, 2015",A1XY86U23W6LQ,B00BGA9Y3W,C. Owen,"Well, I've tried to give this game a fair shot in spite of the negative criticisms it's had. I came into this experience not expecting much, but honestly, after playing the game, I have to say that it was worse than I thought. I mean, it's not BAD, per se. It has lots of elements that you see in good games. Excellent graphics, interesting designs, varied locations, lots of things to loot, and smooth gameplay. The problem is that it all never quite comes together into a compelling experience, and for that, I absolutely blame the publisher, Activision. What the hell did they do to Bungie to downgrade them from a first class developer to a soulless cash cow? But I digress.

The story for this game is quite fascinating and deep, or at least I'm sure it is. I can't confirm that for myself, however, because I don't know what the story is. I just see tantalizing bits of it in the periphery of my vision, occasionally given to me by my robotic ""Ghost"" assistant, then it's gone. But since I'm given no reference point for why it was so significant in the first place, I have no reason to care. The game literally just pitches you face first into the middle of an epic space fantasy universe and immediately expects you to ""get it"". However, even at the beginning of the game, questions abound, and never relent. Who was I? Why did I die? Why did it take so long to bring me back to life? Am I an amnesiac? Who am I fighting? Why am I fighting them? What is the ""darkness"" and the ""light""? Are the evil factions also at war with each other? If so, why? Aren't they part of the ""darkness"" thing we're supposed to be worried about? What is the Traveler, and how is he preventing that city from being destroyed? And what the heck is up with that blue chick and her weird brother? Wait, what was I doing? Oh, God, am I an amnesiac for *real* now?!

The worst part is that you'll go into a mission with a vague idea of what you're supposed to be doing, told that it's very important for some convoluted reasons, then you'll immediately forget what your objective was and why it was important. I mean, for all I know, I'm actually the bad guy and I'm in the service of some evil deity, and we're killing aliens not for freedom but for mad loot. And then you kill an evil space blob, who is Satan, and suddenly you saved the day... apparently? I mean, we did? How? What? Huh? What's this about light ranks? Why am I doing these missions over and over again? Please buy the expansion?

Then there is the gameplay, which is, well, it's good. I mean, it's Bungie (supposedly), so the guns feel good to shoot. But still, a few things feel off. For instance, the automatic weapons are all practically worthless. They spray bullets carelessly everywhere to little effect. Okay, maybe that's just a matter of balance, but they overdid it. What matters far more in this game is not getting bullets on target, but getting *headshots*, as they are much more devastating, but they are also very difficult to achieve with a fully automatic weapon. There's also some odd choices made with the other gun types. Like, why are there three or four shot revolvers? Five is the minimum! Okay, three or four shot guns do exist (usually not as revolvers), but who would bring them into a battlefield? The stats are also hard to understand. Like, there's a category for stopping power, if I recall correctly. Okay, what does that do? And how does that relate to the damage my gun does? Finally, battles are a letdown. Every fight in Halo felt like a special event, with enemies and environments carefully chosen for the experience. Sometimes it feels that way here, but it's just as often that you'll bump into some aliens, shrug, and blast them with little effort.

Then there's magic. Yes, you have magic powers. The thing is, they all work on fairly lengthy cooldowns, so most of the killing work is done with guns. These powers are also somewhat analogous to each other, so even though they technically work differently between the classes, it doesn't seem to be sufficient to make them FEEL different. Playing as a Warlock, I can say that at no point did I feel like a space wizard. No, I was just another guy with a gun who happened to be able to throw weird grenades.

As for the missions, as mentioned before, some grand reason is always given for doing them, but it always feels like you're just a space hitman off to shoot his latest victim, with all other details being superfluous. They play out the same, too: Drop in, drive to the objective, kill guys along the way, wait for the Ghost to do something, kill more guys, then fight a boss. It's easy to see why the details fade away when you've felt like you've done it all before. You can try multiplayer, but I didn't care for it. Technically rank doesn't matter because everything is evened out, but in reality, some players will have more abilities than lower ranked players, and the fights simply lacked that smooth ebb and flow that Halo had in its multiplayer.

It's all just a damn shame because all the elements of a great game are *right there*. Something had to happen partway through development--I've heard of firings and script changes--that completely torpedoed everything, and ultimately brought us this. It would be easy to compare this to games like Borderlands, but Borderlands' plot made total sense and was a blast to play by comparison. Again, I'm forced to lay the blame for this on Activision, who, I presume, let itself get carried away with greed and just wanted Bungie as some other recognizable name to callously mine for profit, but never had any intention of allowing a true Bungie experience.","Bungie, are you feeling okay?",1445299200,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

You know that you are in trouble when the PC game recommends the controller for the console it was ported from - and when you find AI files from STAR TREK ARMADA dated 1998 in the installation directory.

It is difficult to change the control settings for novice users.  There is no in-game menu to do such - you are required to edit a file in notepad/textpad to do this.

The graphics settings constantly reset themselves if you try to edit the config files to actually make the game look decent.

There is little to no tactical depth... you can warp right in to planets/asteroids and it does no damage to your ship.  There is no factor in a battle beyond your ship's stats versus whoever you are fightings stats - so the bigger ship wins always.

It would have been nice to run into an asteroid field as the Defiant - zigzagging among asteroid while the Romulan Warbird chasing you ends up getting plowed by an asteroid because of its sluggish controls - weakening it enough so that you can turn and do some damage while it is hurt.

Instead it follows you in, shrugs off all the asteroids and then kills you in 10 seconds because you cannot warp out of the asteroid field.

Shield facings are irrelevant... so no tactical decisions there.  The only relevance (and it is small) is the range you are before you open up with phasers.

There is excellent sound and voiceovers in this game... but it does not save the trainwreck that it has become.  I was expecting a lot more... and I wish the extended development time (and multiple push-backs of my shipping here at Amazon) were used to improve the programming (not sticking with header files from a 1998 game) instead of just recording voiceovers.

It would be nice if the developer opened up the game for modding teams to save.  As-is, I think that Mad Doc spent more time on the intro movie advertising their company than they did on the game.

I reluctantly accepted the removal of the keyboard instrument in hopes of getting a functional sequel to a long-running franchise that I really love.

This game actually has less songs than both Rock band 2 and Rock Band 3. This issue is compounded by the fact that many songs are niche, mediocre and all over the place in terms of genre (a lot of this is subjective, I know). Some songs stand out from the rest, and are fun to play, which is what's important. For me, the inclusion of Dream Theater's Metropolis Part 1 is what sold the game for me since it's one of my personal favorite songs of all time, but that is the hardest song in the game, meaning once I beat that, there's not much left for me to feel compelled to continue playing.

However, I will probably never be able to beat that song unless a massive update comes our way that fixes all the latency problems the new instruments have (for the record, the firmware updates do not fix all of the problems). Sure, I could whip out all my old instruments, but each of them have problems due to age, wear and tear, which is the main reason I ordered the Band-in-a-Box bundle in the first place.

The microphone works great in my experience, however, so if that is the part you enjoy most, you will likely enjoy the game more than others.

The game itself also has issues, especially due to Harmonix stripping the game of the extensive customization options that Rock Band 3 had. You also cannot access album info, view high scores per instrument, rate songs, filter your song list (this is a nightmare for those with lots of DLC), or create playlists in quickplay mode. Not all of the DLC available for RB3 is available yet for RB4. The character animations seem worse than previous games, and despite the game being 1080p and 60fps (the latter of which is a blessing and probably the one and only gameplay improvement that makes a difference in my opinion), the character and location designs seem less detailed than previous games, and the band members move around awkwardly while playing on stage.

If I had to guess, I would assume this game was rushed to release due to all of the problems and lack of features. Until it gets a massive update, I cannot recommend this game to anyone, especially fans of previous iterations in the series. If you have Rock Band 3, hold on to it and enjoy that until this game can get its act together.

While the RAT 7 remains one of the most ridiculously beautiful gaming mice in existence, the developers put very little thought to the build quality and reliability of this mouse.

The mouse can be physically modified, from the angle of grip, the weight and resistance, to even switching out parts to completely fit your style of Mouse-Gripping.

This happened seldomly, however after a few years and up to this point, the double-clicking is now once every other click, to the point where I have to run autohotkey with a custom script to ignore the second accidental click.

Audio sounds decent and the mic is fine with no echo or other problems.  If it lasts, this will be a great low priced xbox one headset.  I didn't rate it 5 stars because they didn't include a headset adapter for use with the earlier xbox one controllers that don't have a headset port.
Pros - very comfortable, decent sound and decent mic
Cons - no headset adapter for use with original xbox one controllers.
If it lasts, it could be a solid alternative to the turtle beach xo one, which for me, only lasted two months before the mic quit working.  But at least the turtle beach includes the headset adapter.  If this one doesn't last, I will be sure to come back and update my review accordingly.","Mic stopped working after a month and a half, was great while it lasted",1446940800,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It could be hard to hear voices without bass rattling your skull if music was playing simultaneous to vocals (especially on blu-rays.)

I could see elements of where they were trying to go and that would have been more interesting, but as it always got interesting they decided to pull back and not explore that aspect of either the character or the story.  Certain events take place in the beginning and then don't get addressed until midway or even towards the end of the game.  Characters leave and join for no solid reason except at an attempt to throw a curve ball that didn't pan out.  The characters are very bland.  There are no real flaws with any of them.  Secrets were never addressed (if the character had any) and the main character was too perfect.  There was no tension where you felt the character might fail other than you just not being skilled enough to progress the game.

Speaking of skills, the skill & stats system is probably one of the most convoluted thing I've ever experienced since the crystarium system in FFXIII.  It is a system designed to make me think I can use any equipment I so choose, but in reality it is telling me that while I can do that I really should be using this weapon with this armor and with this accessory because leveling up does not boost stats in a way where normal RPGs do it.  How it works is there is an equipment grid and in order to get the maximum bonus, you'll have to align the markers on the grid in a column.  Also, if you switch out any one of them with an item that doesn't have a marker in that column, you lose your bonus stats.  Also, you can't check how equipment affects your stats when purchasing new equipment.  It doesn't reveal the grid in the shop window nor does it show how it affects the character's stats.  Your only indicator is a green arrow for increase and red for decrease, but green doesn't mean all stats increase.  It can mean one stat boosts while another drops and you have no way of seeing that so you'll have to gamble.

The story is pretty basic.  You're the chosen one on a quest to bring balance to the energies of the world.  Nothing else to say about it really.

Overall though, it isn't a completely terrible play.  It is very colorful and it runs okay.  The voice acting is done well both english and japanese.

202773,3.0,False,"11 18, 2011",ARTRFSZQPWY9I,B002I08RA0,Ian B. Cooper,"Don't get me wrong - I'm enjoying playing this game, but where I was expecting slightly less than previous games (it is the third sequel after all), the team just doesn't seem to have been able to get anywhere near the same level of quality that AC2 or Brotherhood achieved.

This game is a big let-down for my favored playstyle in AC. The best aspects of AC2 and Brotherhood have been cut out - where are the faction missions? Where are the Animus puzzles? Where is 'The Truth'? Where is the city rebuilding (sure, stores open and faction buildings get new banners, but buildings no longer truly get 'rebuilt' due to your input)? Hay bales but no horses - what's that all about? And all the cuts seem to have been made in order to make room for a hideously clunky Den Defense mini-game and the over-hyped but useless bomb crafting (two bomb types are all you ever need). Plus they added in more Desmond storyline - just what we always wanted (sarcasm) - and that part of the game is by far the most annoying part of any AC game - worse even than the first game's Desmond segments. Leonardo is missing (and sorely missed) and has been replaced by the bombmaker, who is well played but his role is small. Ezio's touching love interest in Brotherhood has been replaced by what can only be described as a bland and singularly boring librarian (what he sees in her I do not know).

For fast travel, things are just slightly annoyingly worse than Brotherhood: Ziplines are cool, but never there when you need them, and the same is true of the other method of speeding around the city; the sewers, which are too few and far between.

The voice acting, while still good overall, suggests some time and money pressures - Altair sounds suspiciously like Ezio at some points and some of the voice acting in the lesser roles is patchy.

One thing I thought was a big mistake that happened with Brotherhood - the one big city concept that superceded the three cities of AC1 and 2 - I thought changing to one big city made Brotherhood too big and boring. This game confirms that belief. I've been to Istanbul - big it is, boring it ain't. Another thing is that Ezio's Istanbul is missing some of the historical depth that the previous games all had. Surely the machinations that took place in Istanbul after its fall must have been as interesting as what happened in Borgia Italy, but what we get is a timid and superficial look at the Ottoman Empire in the 1500s. The historical depth is just not there. AC1, AC2 and Brotherhood all felt like I'd been transported back in time, but with Revelations, it just feels like I've been handed a guidebook to Istanbul.

There are a couple of big improvements:
1, the dungeon segments are a bit more varied and a bit less creepy: I dreaded every dungeon mission in AC2 and Brotherhood.
2, you get to do more stuff with the assassin minions and they get to take over and run other cities for you. The only problem is, once they start running other cities, it takes up something like 50% of your playing time because you have to constantly send them on missions to prevent the Templars retaking the city. I wish there was some way to make your assassins do missions in their cities without needing your input.

Okay, it's still a good game - barely good, but in my opinion it's not in the same league as the previous AC games. There are just too many developer decisions that obviously were not thought through.

This game makes me glad that they're starting fresh with another character and another time setting for the next AC game. Ezio has overstayed his welcome just a tad (and I really never expected to say that). But the flaws in this game also make me fear that they'll completely mess up the next installment.",A bit disappointing,1321574400,70,"{'Edition:': ' Standard with TriOviz 3D Glasses', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

I still stand by my initial assessment that the A.I is horrible and predictable like before. The graphics are very much improved though thanks to the excellent Q3 engine used this time. I did find the game to be a bit more buggy than I have been accustomed to seeing from the Q3 engine in other games that utilized it as well.  I got frustrated on several levels of the game that required stealth. You don't have any silent weapons that I have seen except the knife and a pistol with a silencer on it. The problem I have run into though is that any little action or movement you do sets off the alarms even if the soldiers don't know you're there so it makes it near impossible to complete these levels. The first time I played the game it took me 20-30 times each to finally finish the stealth oriented levels. It just boils down to poor organization in parts of the game. Overall though it was a great game. It has a great plot and an engrossing storyline. That combined with the great graphics made it an excellent game to play.

 It's hard to rate this game without breaking it down.

 The attentional to detail,artwork and environment in this game 5/5! The world itself has a lot going on for it. There is plenty to explore and gaze at if you just pause to look around. Detail is everywhere and it really helps with immersion into the game.

 Storyline 5/5 they spent time developing a story that gives you options and keeps you following along instead of just leveling and doing mundane quest to end game level. The world changes and the quest line progresses so that in itself is engaging enough to keep you replaying the game trying different characters for different questlines.

Gameplay 3/5 It's flashy and simple but not very challenging. Compared to GW1 where people complained it was too hard (believe me it could be dreadfully hard) this game holds your hand. It's hard to be killed when fighting normal level bosses. The game is much more generous to you as it has no Death penalty. When before if you were killed on a hard boss it only became worse as you lost about 10% max health each time. The game is very forgiving now and that takes away from the challenge that Guildwars used to offer.

Gameplay Part 2cont. 3/5 the skill sets you use are very watered down from the old format of building a unique set of skills. Each character has 5 main moves and 5 secondary moves. The main attacks alter between weapons and the secondary attacks you can pick and choose. There is a lot less freedom than before when having hundreds of skills and combinations to choose from. That is a main drawback for those that enjoyed the variety of the old game. As there are different skills and weapons there is a set number of skills that you use and after the 100monster or so you kill it's quite redundant. For other games no big deal for guildwars it's a kick down from what we once had.

The game community 2/5! As an MMO the idea is to play along with other players. Over time this concept has changed from people being sociable to Soloquesting Online. Most players in GW2 play alone and rarely interact with other players unless they need too. There are guilds as this is ""GuildWars"" but despite the name it's never been ""Guild"" dependent unless you were doing PVP. I haven't gotten too far into PVP yet but plan to engage in that later when my computer is better capable to handle the lag.

The games community is there but it's non existent as most people just stay to themselves. Even in guilds people will do their own independent tasks and join up for a mission or dungeon and that's about it. So maybe it's a change in MMO behavior or the idea that MMO's are no longer that interesting and new anymore since the idea of playing with someone else online is rather old now there just isn't a need for grouping or playing with other players. For myself as well as old guild wars players its a bit of a let down. After years of playing in instanced worlds with NPC's you finally get a true MMO of your favorite game only to have the actual players run around not engaging with other people and just soloing content. At points I found myself wishing for the Questing NPC's back just so I wouldn't have to quest alone and be so bored. So what are all these people doing? They're ""farming"" which means they're running around to map area's and gather materials to get achievements and make items later on. When people say this game is a ""gear grind"" It's those people that are doing it. The truth is that this game is not a ""gear grind"" it's just the behavior those people choose to engage in when playing this game. They choose to not really be social, they choose to rush the game by not exploring or experiencing the content but just getting from point A to point B, and they choose to make the game all about getting the next piece of equipment. The reality is that the game is amazingly large and detailed and as I said before there is a lot to take in and discover beyond the points of interests listed on the map.

In the past I made the mistake of blaming the game itself for being boring or tedious and casting these people into the grind of this mundane behavior but the truth is that these people do it to themselves. In just about all of these MMO's that have come out. The get into the concept of turning a game into a chore and they stick with it no matter what game they play. Rush to max level, grind for the best armor, then complain about being bored. The community is very different from the old GW community that wasn't so much ""grind"" oriented but ""game"" oriented. If you quested you quested well, if you PVP'd you PVP'd well, You were just playing the game and not necessarily chasing accomplishments they just came with it. The concept of the old GW community is completely gone in the new world. It's been modernized to cater to the grinding crowd which isn't very enjoyable because they never add any substance to the game other than their characters solemnly playing in the background.

The world of Guild Wars 2 really feels split. On one hand you have the backdrop to a great story and goodtimes but on the other hand you have a community that doesn't want to engage in those things. It's somewhat like driving to an amusement park and instead of getting on any of the rides you just walk around the park looking at idle roller coasters and decide to pick dandelions laying about instead. No one seems to take advantage of what the game is offering instead they choose to turn the game into something that's not fun at all to play.

I don't feel I got my money's worth.  As it seems, Blizzard just didn't get innovative with this title.  Much like I heard about Starcraft 2, it wasn't very innovative.  It was just Starcraft 1 with updated graphics.  Blizzard spent a long time making both these games, but I'm not really sure what it was they were doing.  Diablo 3 is mildly fun the first time through, though it is exceptionally easy.  Most loot that drops is a good 10 levels below you.  The auction house easily ruins the game if you choose to use it.

312362,3.0,False,"12 5, 2014",ADJKMC7AO7YN3,B00DBFD5WQ,Jayson Olson,"(Update 12/17):: Well after almost three weeks, I have a few new comments: 1) According to the UBIsoft forum's, the developers are aware of the overpowered (invincible, that is) police chasings and AI rubberbanding and vowed to look at it and 'possibly' make some adjustments, but so far nothing in the form of client side patches, although it is rumored there will be an update at the end of Dec or beginning of Jan.  2) I can promise you in saying that multiplayer is a hot & miss, and more times a not a miss.  There have been numerous occasions now I have joined a lobby for over 30 minutes at a time waiting, only to NEVER be able to get The Crew matchmaking to get 8 players together for a faction mission.  Yup, 30 minutes and the most I've ever had at any given time is 5 people, all waiting for 3 more to start a mission...I don't care what the developers or others say, the PvP lobbies are just BROKEN. I've had better luck with a few co-op missions, but barely...at least with these I've been able to play with 2 or 3 others for a quick 3 minute mission, but again, that's very hit & miss.  3) Some missions are very tough for a casual player.  Even if your car outclasses the others by many levels, you almost always have to drive perfect...One miniscule error will see you fail the mission immediately, only to repeat it dozens of times.  Not cool.  ::

First, let's get the basic premise out of the way up front and just *maybe* the overall feel of the game will make more sense.  The Crew is intended as an *arcade* game not a *simulator*, so those expecting the intricacies of a Forza type game need to lower their expectations.

In short, The Crew mashes up a traditional MMO (usually reserved for Fantasy and Sci/FI dungeon crawlers) and mashes it up with race cars.  So, instead of leveling up your armor, swords, and spells, you're in-fact leveling up your vehicles in the form of brakes, engine, weight reduction, etc.  Pretty cool concept and a first for a new genre, so I have to give the developers credit...although clearly as a first entry into the genre, of course there is room for improvements.

The game is meant to be a casual racing romp, where a player can dive in for a few missions, either solo, with a few friends (your crew), or random players.  The story, while a bit shallow, only serves to give players a sense of progressing and high level view of missions and purpose.  Don't be thinking this is deep character driven prose like Mass Effect or Dragon Age, again....this is an arcade-like driving MMO, not a game intended for players to examine every granular level of specs and back story.  So let me get down to my overall impressions (*subject to change as patches, DLC, and further game progressions warrant).

Because this is an MMO, a constant connection to the Internet must be in play.  If your net is down, you won't be playing, even solo.

Tutorial/Manual: The game does not ship with a standard paper manual and the ingame first few missions and introduction prologue somewhat serves as a tutorial, but is pretty flimsy.  You get some of the major and obvious points addressed, but you end up discovering more functions through trial and error, by accident, or at the beginning of a specific mission or skill test.  You'll find that only through retrying or repeating missions will you discover controller functionality you were never advised to previously which can prove frustrating to early players.  My feeling is they could have done much better here.

Graphics: Nothing mind blowing here.  Perhaps a bit above average.  Because this is a large, open world moving at high speed, I imagine the graphics were pared back a bit to ensure GPU/CPU's could chug along.  There are some random details that are impressive within cities and building facades, but you will notice some repetition here and there, while other world items are `okay'.  Cars are nice with some cool customization (sticker, paint jobs, etc), but again, don't expect GT or Forza modeling.

Sound: Adequate.  There are some ambient cue's about the world, you'll note the difference in engine's and exhaust as you modify them though the engine notes could be amped up a bit more.  The stereo soundtrack is a bit dull.  I wish they would have taken the approach of the GTA games and licensed both a larger library and hit songs (here's to hoping future patches will bring more variety).  The most annoying things are the constant voiceovers during missions.  They get repetitive fast.

Economy: There are 3 types of ingame economy: 1) ""Bucks"" - cash earned ingame for completing missions, selling parts and are used to buy/repair/modify your cars.  2) ""Crew Credits"" - a micro transaction feature where you spend real money to buy CC to spend ingame for the same as cash; buy/repair/modify your cars. 3) ""Award Points"" or AP which are awarded by completing ingame achievements like exploration, multiplayer events, driving a certain way, collecting things, etc.  Supposedly when you complete a `tier' it unlocks special content....what that is at this point I have no idea.

Specs: Early on you only have a few choices of cars.  You can specialize (i.e. loadout) your collection of cars for specific driving styles such as street, off road, performance, raid, etc.  Ranking up in skill challenges or purchasing specific parts will allow you to buy better parts for you cars...maybe your street car needs additional acceleration where as your offroad vehicle could use better tires suited for mud.  Seems to be a lot a choice and depth within, but what makes a +5 exhaust better than a +4 exhaust (for example) is a bit vague.

PvP: It's a tad too early to tell right now.  The game is only in its first week and matchmaking is a bit buggy right now, while many of us are still getting used to the game and driving.

Missions: There isn't a ton of variety here, and some of the story plot points are a bit thin on why you're doing what you are doing but basically there are: 1) Races (come in first), 2) Take down (eliminate a target car), 3) Raid (sorta like time trials while completing other tasks), 4) Faction (control a territory with your crew) and a few others.  While the game encourages co-op, right now it's a bit wonky.  That's partly due to no `coherent' instructions, server matchmaking/stability/lag, player population (until more get online), and people dropping out for whatever reason.  You can most of the mission solo, but some of the harder ones really do need co-op play, but until the player base stabilizes, they can prove hard to pull off.

A.I.: To me this is the most frustrating part of the game.  Simply put, no matter how great your car is, it seems as if the NPC cars, and especially the Police have this uncanny (and often unrealistic) ability to either catch up or even surpass you.  The effect of `rubber-banding' is quite evident here, cars you thought you left in the dust miraculously pull in front of seemingly out of nowhere.  Police are not only aggressive, but almost impossible to shake even if your car is theoretically maxed.  Mini Coopers should also not be able to keep up with high end muscle cars, but they do in The Crew.  The devs said they are aware of this and are looking into it, so hopefully this will be tuned and balanced in the upcoming weeks.

Gameplay and Control:  Beginners and even other racing enthusiasts may find the early levels a bit daunting.  Your `stock' cars, until you level them up suffer in handling and breaking.  Physics are a bit over the top and only practice and improvements will find you finally getting a handle on your driving skills.  While trigger layout seems natural, button layout seems a bit awkward.  Sometimes `normal' difficulty appears much harder than you'd think, for one false move could see that you never catch up to a pack or have a chance to complete a mission.  In some instances (not all) it seems you have to drive almost perfect, and MUST take advantage of pre-determined shortcuts, otherwise even coming in 2nd place will see you fail a mission.  Crashing into a hard object or spinning out early on almost guarantees you'll need to do the mission over because you're just not going to overtake the A.I. cars.  Some missions are a bit more forgiving than others, but not by much.

Open World: This is a shining star here.  There is a lot to see from coast to coast, and plenty of challenges and collectibles along the way.  You don't have to do any skill challenges or collect anything if you don't want to, but they do collect you additional XP and unlock various items, even hidden cars to add to your inventory.  There's a ton of potential here and Devs have promised new content and challenges down the road.","'Promising' arcade racer, but room for improvements.",1417737600,11,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I have completed about 80% of the game.  I am also a big fan of the series having played all that were available on the Playstion.

The good

Some of the graphics are really good
They improved the parkour movement by letting you move down by holding O.  Works nearly as well as holding X does for climbing.
The buildings feel more realistic, sized better.
I like the introduction of equipment slots and stat bonuses

The Bad

Very glitchy, unpolished overall
NPCs walking through walls into spaces they shouldn't be.
I have had to reboot twice do to NPCs getting stuck and not triggering cut scenes in missions
I have gotten stuck in walls/objects when using cover, had to restart from last checkpoint.
Very glitchy to interact with some objects, sometimes you can be several feet away, sometimes you have to be lined up just right
Melee is like molasses....slow.  It seems like animations are partly to blame.  I dunno, its just very slow and clunky compared to previous titles.
The storyline is almost non existent.
Character development is non existent.
There are so many different points/currencies needed for things that I am still not even sure how some are collected or what their used for.  (ingame money, helix points, creed points etc)
I seriously hope other games makers do not follow suit and try to integrate phone style micro purchases.
I hope even more fervently that game makers don't follow this example and integrate a phone app to the point where you have to do stuff on the phone to unlock things in the game.  Its very annoying to see chests that you cannot open in game.

The Mixed

Lockpicking.  I think I like this, they did a pretty good job of making it challenging but I think they should have taken some more time and developed a more unique approach.

Overall I think that the French Revolution is a poor event to base an Assassin Creed game on.  There really wasn't a good side in that conflict, just bad and worse.  So its hard to have a clear cut assassins vs templars in this environment and it bleeds through into this game.

Underwhelming Graphics
Weak Sound Design
Confusing/Pointless Story

Resistance: Fall of Man was once known as THE title to own for PlayStation 3, way back in 2006 when the console launched.  Since then, the PS3 has seen many more great titles released giving potential buyers a reason to pick up a PS3, other than for a Blu-ray player.  Is Resistance 2 one of those games you just have to buy a PlayStation 3 to play? Well, technically yes because it is an exclusive to PS3.  But NO, this game is not a system seller.

The first game was given great reviews, and I played through it and came away very underwhelmed.  The same thing is true of Resistance 2.  There wasn't much hype for this game, other then for die hard fans of the first game.  I was optimistic about the sequel, as I couldn't quite figure out what made Resistance: Fall of Man so forgettable.  Resistance 2 is better then the first game, and improves upon every aspect but still falls short from being a great game.

The story picks up where the last game left off, but from the game's opening, you are immediately confused to why any of this matters. Yes, there is obviously a war going on, so I guess that is a good enough reason to shoot things.  But when the game opens saying ""This is his story"" (Nathan Hale, the controlled character's story), and you learn nothing the first few hours of the game, no explanation for anything that's going on, it is hard to care.

The graphics and sound are another average part of the game. I'm not going to say that they are bad, but they are just nothing better then average.  With titles like Gears of War, LittleBigPlanet, Metal Gear Solid 4 out, Resistance 2 looks like just another FPS.  Sure, there are some gigantic moments in this game, but nothing will make you jaw drop or make you want to play it over so you can show a friend how far video games have gone.  The color palette  is much brighter this time around, but I think that may be the only (noticeable) improvement from the first game. The water, first, and explosion effects all look a little strange, especially the water.  Explosions are very dull.  The sound is equally boring.  It seems like the same music is playing at the end and beginning of each mission, and there isn't much in between (or if there is you won't notice it).  The gun sounds are the best part, as is the pretty decent use of surround sound.

The gameplay may be the biggest downside for this game.  Everything feels off, from moving your character to targeting.  The controls feel loose, and the default control scheme is a little awkward at first.  The cursor moves pretty quick when trying to aim, and can actually be a little touchy when zoomed, but it takes far too long to turn around when getting attacked from behind.  The screen zooms in when you run for some stupid reason, and just makes not sense.  While most reviews I have read say that the AI is superb, I have to disagree.  Countless times I have seen an enemy run out into the open, then start shooting (only at you, even when you have allies with you) and standing in one spot.  The only time they show any signs of life is when they charge at you and try to melee you, but even that is a dumb act.

As far as value goes, this is one thing that the game has going for it.  The single player campaign is around 10 hours, then there is a separate cooperative campaign for up to 8 players, and then 60 player competitive multiplayer.

And this is because I truly suck compared to most FPS gamers. I am at best an average player that enjoys FPS's but the complete and utter suffering I have endured online during years of MW and COD have resulted in a series of premature abandonments of 60 dollar titles. Finally, for as much slack as it has received,  Ghost's Squads totally saved my butt in online participation as I do OK and don't get slaughtered the minute I enter the field. With all the noise over Titanfall, I had hoped for a fresh chance to compete with all the other kids with its claims of original gameplay, so that I might have another opportunity to be OK online. But without the ability to practice in any way, no single player to try different styles, I still get butchered by the run-and-gunners. Sadly, Ghosts Squads (and the Ripper) still is a better online experience for the average (or below) player.

That perked my interest so I read some previews about the game which said it was very deep in exploration, item gathering and crafting.  I found that to be fairly misleading.  The only craftable items you will gather are plants and animal skins.  That's it.  Plants can be combined to make syringes of various effects such as health restoration, being able to see enemies through walls, resistance to fire, increased damage, etc.  The animal skins are combined to unlock certain perks like the ability to carry more weapons, carry more ammo, carry more loot, carry more money, carry more syringes and carry more grenades.

The only other items you can pick up are enemies' weapons, which are almost always worse than what you're already carrying, and loot, which you can sell for money.  So while yes it's a little deeper than a straight forward shooter, the ""Skyrim with Guns"" label does a disservice to Skyrim.  This game is still a shooter, it merely has a couple of extra perks.

The enemies also lack in variety.  Outside of one instance which I won't spoil, you'll only ever battle humans and animals.  I'm not sure what else they could have done to provide more variety while keeping the realistic setting, but shooting the same group of tribesman over and over becomes a bit boring, and once you have upgraded all of your gear there's no reason to hunt animals anymore outside of selling their skins, which is less profitable than simply looking for loot.

There are a couple of other features that attempt to break up the monotony such as a knife throwing mini game, poker, a ""pass through all the check points in time"" race on ATV's or vehicles, and climbing radio towers which will open up portions of the map and display their loot locations and topography, much like the Assassin's Creed series.  You can also hang glide around the islands which is fairly fun the first few times, but they never really work it in as a mandatory thing for any missions, such as hang gliding into an otherwise impenetrable enemy fortress to raise hell.  I kept expecting that to happen and it never did, it's merely a tacked on feature that serves no real purpose other than taking in the sights and traveling a little faster if you're headed downhill.

The guns in the game feel good to shoot but nothing mind blowing about them.  Pistols, SMG's, Assault Rifles, Shotguns, LMG's, Sniper Rifles, bow and arrows, a flame thrower, an RPG and a grenade launcher will be at your disposal, as well as a melee knife.  There are a handful of different guns per category, each of which has different levels of customization such as adding a silencer, extended magazine, scopes, etc.  You can also add a paint job to most guns which shows up on the in-game skin.

Leveling up through gaining experience will allow you to unlock perks such as the ability to silently take down enemies from above or below with your knife, silently take down multiple enemies with your knife, reload faster, switch weapons faster, hold your breath longer under water, drag enemies' bodies, acquire more loot, etc.

The story line is a bit unbelievable, you seem to be a spoiled rich kid on vacation in the tropics who gets abducted by the local warlord.  You somehow escape and then it's your mission to free your friends and exact vengeance on the warlord.  The problem is that the whiny rich kid instantly knows how to handle all of these weapons like a pro despite no combat experience.  This is partially explained later on in the story but the main character just never felt believable.  The friends you're trying to save also hardly seem worth saving, from the controlling and bitchy girlfriend to the stoner who doesn't want to leave the island anyway.

In the end the game is still fun and definitely worth playing because it handles the shooter mechanics well and there's enough of an RPG style system in place to make it more than a mindless shooter.  Running and gunning will get you killed quickly so planning out your assault and using some stealth is ideal in most situations and will reward you with more experience as well as keep you alive.

It's a lot of fun, and allows you to fly some terrific pseudo-historical missions set in the WWII era.  Visually, it's very nice, though I wish it had full head-tracker support (which is pretty much crucial for prop-era non-radar-equipped aircraft without AWACS/etc.

There's a problem with this game, though...  and if you run modern hardware, you'll very likely encounter it.  The problem is a so-called ""copy protection"" scheme which is bundled with the game called ""Safedisk.""  Safedisk encrypts the actual game executable (in an ""ICD"" file) and when you run the apparent game-executable, it merely decrypts the REAL executable and runs it.

In concept, not that bad of an idea.  In execution, a HORRIBLE one.  Because, for example, if you have a CD burner or the equivalent, and the Safedisk tools identify that, it will simply refuse to decrypt the file, and you will ""crash to desktop.""  It's not a problem with the program itself, it's a problem with the supposed ""copy protection"" technique.

If you want to run in a compatibility mode... well, that would work just fine with the ACTUAL executable, but not in this case.  You'll be putting the ""decrypter"" into compatibility mode, not the actual game executable.  And the decrypter will fail if you put it into a compatibility mode, most of the time.  Plus, of course, you're prevented from making settings which apply to the game executable which might allow it to run properly (through setting compatibility settings).

SO...  If you're willing to gamble with getting this running, I recommend it.  But if you're not technically savy, and don't have a LOT of patience... and if you expect what you buy to just work out of the box...  don't bother.  The odds are not in your favor.","A great game, vitally crippled by very, very bad copy protection",1423785600,,,

Here, at the last moments of the Wii's life before the Wii U arrives, Nintendo has unleashed what they consider the system's magnum opus.  And does it live up to the hype?  Well...yes and no.  Let me get this out of the way:  Skyward Sword gets a lot of things right...but it's FAR from perfect.  Is it the best Zelda game in existence?  Absolutely, unequivocally no!  Not even close.  I know this opinion differs from the norm, and I apologize to Zelda fanatics everywhere.  But I simply couldn't give this game the free pass that most critics happily bestowed upon it.

I'll start with what the game did well.  First and foremost...the story.  This is the most story-driven Zelda game ever, and it presents it in the most charming and beautiful way possible.  Bright, cel-shaded, picturesque graphics are used to tell and equally beautiful story (goodness...if the Wii could display in HD this would be the best-looking game of the year).  The game begins by introducing us to the main characters in their home in the sky, Skyloft.  Link and Zelda are schoolmates.  Zelda herself is given a huge role here, and we genuinely end up caring for her and Link's relationship.  In the brief time that we see them interact together, Nintendo managed to make a lasting impression of its two main characters that remains throughout the game's entire 50+ hours.  The school bully, Groose, is also a hoot (whose role later in the game is pretty cool).  Once tragedy strikes and the main story begins, we're introduced to Fi, a robotically-inclined personification of Link's Master Sword (more on her later).  Then, there's Ghirahim, the main villain.  Nintendo has clearly outdone themselves with this character.  He's creepy, maniacal, and very well-written.  The entire tale is accompanied by what is possibly the best soundtrack to any Zelda game I've heard.  This goes double for the handful of melodies that are fully-orchestrated.  The game's ending is simply fantastic, solidifying the fact that Skyward Sword is an origin story and setting the stage for the fifteen Zelda games that follow it chronologically.  Also, Skyward Sword has the best variety of special items of any Zelda game.  The beetle, the bellows, the whip...all new additions that are a blast to use!

Where the game falters is in pretty much every other aspect.  As far as content, Skyward Sword is extremely anemic.  Unlike superior Zelda titles, there are only three areas in Skyward Sword, and you must go to them over and over.  Faron Woods, Eldin Volcano and Lanayru Desert.  That's it.  You will become intimately familiar with these areas (as well as Skyloft, which is the hub world).  Not sure why Nintendo skimped on environments.  The sky is littered with a few floating islands in addition to Skyloft, but they're literally tiny fragments that may contain a treasure chest or two.  The rest is just vast empty sky, similar to the empty oceans in The Wind Waker.  Compare this to the vast open worlds of Ocarina of Time or Twilight Princess, and Skyward Sword is pretty substandard.  There's also an alchemy component and item-crafting aspect to Skyward Sword.  The world is littered with random loot, which can be used to upgrade shields and other items.  There's also a variety of bugs that can be caught, and added to potions to give them different abilities.  Despite how cool that sounds, it all turns out to be rather pointless and has a ""tacked on"" feel to the game as a whole.  You don't really NEED the upgrades, and if you do get them, the level of improvement isn't that big.

Another major aspect of this game is the much-lauded motion controls.  Skyward Sword requires the Wii Motion Plus, which the game utilizes to an utterly absurd degree.  To say this game has overdependence on motion controls is the understatement of the year.  The game IS motion controls.  I've heard many people ask, ""Why couldn't they add an option to play with the Classic Controller?""  The truth is that without motion controls, Skyward Sword would be half a game, at best.  The huge majority of the enemies are designed around precisely striking specific areas, and just frantically waving the Wii remote around will result in repeated blocks by your foes.  Boss fights, too, require precise swinging or stabbing.  Flying around the sky requires tilting the remote or ""flapping"" it like it was your wings.  Playing the musical instrument du jour (the Goddess Harp) requires you to wave your remote rhythmically as if you were strumming a harp.  Swimming is also done by tilting the Wii remote.  This is all well and good...and to be fair, the motion controls are fairly precise most of the time.  But no matter how precise they are, they're not more convenient than, nor as precise as, pressing buttons or using an analog stick.  I found the motion controls lost their novelty fairly quickly, and in many cases I found them a nuisance.  Also, the remote was sometimes a bit too sensitive, and reeling my sword back usually resulted in a strike from the opposite direction that I intended...and of course the enemy changed its stance as a result.  I get why Nintendo went this direction, but I feel like it just got in the way.  They should've concentrated more on variety of environments than motion controls.  The harp in particular is pretty curious.  Since they wanted you to use motion controls, playing a song only requires that you wave back and forth.  Gone is the more intuitive approach of having you press buttons or directions to play a specific melody...instead the game decides what to play depending on the mission at hand.

Then there's Fi, your guide throughout the game.  If you thought Navi from Ocarina of Time was annoying, get ready to redefine your criteria.  Fi pops up for the tiniest of reasons merely to state things that are EXTREMELY obvious.  There was a moment where I entered a room and the camera pans to a treasure chest containing the boss key (they come in a bigger, more ornate treasure chest).  Once the camera went back to Link, Fi pops out and says, ""Link!  I have some important information you will want to hear!  There is a treasure chest in this room!  There is an 80% chance it will contain the key!""  Or another example:  Link is in a pirate ship, and suddenly giant tentacles rip through the ship in front of you.  Fi pops out with, ""Link!  I calculate a 90% chance that there is a giant monster outside.  I recommend going outside to investigate!""  It is completely infuriating sometimes since she breaks up the gameplay so often.  It's like Nintendo is terrified at the prospect of having players figure things out on their own.

So there you have it.  Great story, amazing music, awesome items, all mixed with unnecessarily intrusive controls and a world map that would feel limited on a handheld iteration of Zelda, let alone a full console release.  Yes, this is one of the best titles on the Wii, and despite its problems it should be played if you're a Zelda fan.  But in my humble opinion, it fails to improve on the Zelda formula on most fronts, and in the end I rank it as one of the more mediocre Zelda games.",One of the best Wii games...but far from the best in the Zelda franchise,1327276800,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I put many hours into Blops, but I did it more as a chore than enjoyment as I felt the series was veering into a same-y direction. I skipped MW3, Blops 2 and Ghosts as they felt unoriginal to me and lacked that special fun feeling present in MW 1 & 2.

After watching many gameplay videos and reading different reviews, I decided to rent Advanced Warfare from Redbox. I played the first few campaign missions and about 6-7 hours worth of multiplayer. I was very impressed and ended up buying it here on Amazon. The campaign seemed interesting enough to get me to complete it soon (which is more than I can say for other CoDs personally), but where I mostly spend my FPS time is in multiplayer like many.

Im very happy with the direction Sledgehammer has taken AW. The Exo Suit adds a lot of combat versatility to the point where 1v1 engagements can have an epic feel with the maneuvering possibilities. Kill streaks don't have the ridiculously discouraging snow ball effect they started having after MW2, and with the Exo Suit verticality, camping seems to be drastically lower in AW. This last one makes me very happy as the increasing camping was a large reason for me leaving CoD originally.

I do have some concerns. Servers can be laggy probably 1 out of every 3 or 4 games on average. However, the game just came out. Remember BF4's launch? I am a major BF fan, and I can tell you AW's launch is smooth as butter compared to BF. There is talk about the lack of dedicated servers being the main issue, but overall the lag was not enough to make me stop playing.

Another concern is how quickly each gun runs out of ammo. It's common for a magazine of 30 to run out in a matter of seconds during full-auto. What this means is that poor aim in an engagement or when an opponent is Exo-maneuvering will likely get you punished hard. Similarly, melee is horrible right now. It only works if you are literally right up on another players face/body. I wouldn't even use melee at all until they patch it. Just stick with hip fire for now.

But my issues are not greater than what I like about AW. The map designs go very well with the Exo Suit and actually remind me of some of MW2's. The game is definitely fast and it is not as easy to score a high K/D consistently, but kills feel very rewarding overall.

Haven't had this much fun with CoD since MW2. Im glad Sledgehammer managed to bring back that arcade fun-ness back with Advanced Warfare. If it's been a few years since you played CoD, I'd recommend giving this a shot or at least renting it from Redbox. If you liked Titanfall, then I would highly encourage you to try out Advanced Warfare.

Advanced Warfare started off great. Once I hit the 15-hour mark, lag & latency issues made themselves present. After hitting 20 hours, I realized they would not be going away.

One reviewer mentioned it, but he didn't really explain how horrible of a thing it is. To start, Super R-Type is a SNES exclusive that is sort of a worked over port of R-Type II. I actually believe its an improvement over the original R-Type II, featuring more levels, some enhanced graphics and other goodies. What brings this game down (heavily for me) are the complete lack of checkpoints throughout. All R-Type games have ""checkpoints"" during the stage, so that if you die, you can go back and start from near that place within the stage. Some idiot at Irem thought it was a good idea to remove these altogether so if you die just once, even at the end boss, you go ALL of the way back to the beginning, every time. This is ridiculous and completely ruins what would otherwise be a fun and great shooter. Anyone who knows the R-Type series knows that these games are difficult enough to begin with. I cannot believe someone thought it a good idea to remove the checkpoints, as it does nothing but make the game endlessly frustrating, sucking virtually all of the fun out of it. There's nothing like working through a rough stage to a boss, dying once and starting all over again.

In conclusion, this is a great game that was ruined by a dumb decision by some goofball during development. Get it if you're a huge R-Type fan, or skip if if you want to keep your hair from turning grey while playing. There are better R-Type games available that give you the benefit of checkpoints, like R-Type III (also on the SNES) for example.",A good R-Type game marred by a dumb programming decision,1313366400,4,,

Since then, I've ssen them evolve into something I never could have imagined. It seems the general consensus around harcore MK fans is, the newer 3D ones are disappointing and in some respects, I'll agree but there are some things are an improvement. Anyway, not to go off on a tangent here...

MK vs. DC sounds like a great idea (after it sinks in for awhile). When I imagined how it would look and what the gameplay would be like, a smile came across my face but that might have been my own undoing with this game. I imagined a brutal gore fest where Scorpion is impaling Batman with his spear and tearing him in half, Baraka is chopping Wonder Woman to pieces with his blades, Superman is melting Liu Kang into a gooey, bloody pool with his heat vision and The Flash is hitting Jax so hard and so fast that his limbs, head and other body parts start flying off of him one by one.

Unfortunately, the result was actually a watered down MK fighting game. No real brutality, no real blood and even the fatalities are just not very impressive. For instance, Baraka jumps on top of people and impales them but no close up, no pool of blood and no visible post puncture wounds. Sub-Zero body slams people after turning them into a block of ice and they explode but you only see ice chunks, instead of meat, organs and blood like one would expect. Now I understand that the addition of DC characters is going to demand accessability to a certain younger market than MK is used to and had this been a dominantly DC game, it would've worked. This game however, had all the calling cards of an MK game, minus of course those elements that make it a true MK game. Also, where are the acid pool, the human devouring trees, the spiked ceiling and all the other death traps? In the end, the lack of the mature rating did really hurt this game's ability to be truly awesome.

Now. there are some good points, or I wouldn't have given it 3 stars. The graphics and animation are truly stellar, exactly what I've been waiting to see in a next gen MK game. My only beef there is, the MK characters look a helluva lot better then the DC ones. Also, they stripped down the fighting itself and took out the annoying aspects like multiple fighting stances and 15 button combos (ok, maybe I'm exaggerating) that are virtually impossible to pull off. There are still combos but you can easily get by knowing a couple or a few and the special moves. The Klose Kombat feature is really cool but the test your might, freefall and rage modes are just not that good.

It's safe to say that this isn't what I was hoping for. Maybe there's another ""pure"" MK game in store in the not too distant future.",Could have been so much better,1227916800,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

168529,3.0,False,"01 15, 2009",A3EK57ZHMA55G5,B001AZFSDS,Lestor neeker Wong,"Lord of the Rings: Conquest has an interesting premise. It allows you to play through key battles from the movies in epic, cinematic environments. It also includes a ""what if"" option that lets you play an entire campaign as the bad guys. To add depth, it even has characters with different classes, trying to pass itself off as some sort of a RPG. Essentially, however, the game is quite simply a button-masher from start to finish, and a slightly more polished version of Koei's Dynasty Warriors.

Let's first talk about the good things. For one, it's Lord of the Rings. It has undeniable star power, and EA lets you tap into this from time to time. Even though you play through a large part of the game as one of the classes available, there are parts that provides the opportunity for you to play as a specific character to relive a key moment of the show. For example, you get to take on the Witch King as Eowyn, the Balrog as Gandalf and an Oliphaunt as Legolas. These sequences are included as part of the mission objectives, and it's a nice touch to allow the player to play as different characters from the show during different parts of the game. The question then is, why won't EA allow us to play through the entire game as these characters?

Next up, the life system. Unlike many ""modern"" games, LOTR: Conquest actually has a limit on how many times you can die before you have to start a mission all over again. Most games nowadays use checkpoints. You die, you respawn from the last checkpoint. You could save a game beforehand and reload from it to continue on. Not this game. You get a number of lives to start with, and if you exhaust them all, it's game over. It doesn't matter if you lose all your lives at the final boss fight, you simply restart from point A. You also can't manually save the game at any point in time, which is really unforgiving on the hardest difficulty level. I can't be sure if this is a ""good"" point to you, but what it does is that it encourages you to be more careful in your approach. It's easy to simply choose the standard melee Warrior class and rush in for a massive fight everytime for every mission, but at times, the mission gets easier if you actually uses ranged attacks, magic, or stealth.

These tie in with the classes in the game - you get the Warrior (melee), the Archer (range), the Mage (magic) and the Scout (stealth). Each class plays slightly differently than another, with different sets of combos and abilities to boot. The Archer, for example, can shoot both poisonous and fire arrows, while the Scout can throw bombs on enemies. These keep playing styles varied, if you actually bother to switch classes on a regular basis. Unfortunately, it's good only for as long as it lasts.

This is when I talk about the bad points. Despite the varied fighting styles for the classes, the game is essentially the same through out. You've many objectives to fulfil in the various missions, but eventually it all points to one thing: enemies swarming, kill them all. This is exactly why I compare it to the hack-and-slash legend (ahem) Dynasty Warriors. To make matters worse, all abilities are given to all classes from the start, so there's no new combos to learn, and no new abilites to use. This also means that there's no scaling difficulties from mission to mission. Enemies in the final mission behave similarly in the first one. All these add to the repetition, which is no surprise when it gets old really quickly. At least, in Dynasty Warriors, you actually level up your characters.

The game also ends too quickly for me. Those who know me would know that I love short games, but seriously, this short? The ""good"" and ""evil"" campaigns each has seven to eight missions, and each mission is achievable in about 15-30 minutes. You do the maths on how fast the exercise would be. At the point of writing, I've already completed the ""good"" story, and it hasn't even been a day since I bought the game.

Perhaps EA is banking on the multiplayer feature to generate longetivity. Unfortunately, deathmatch and capture the flag types have been played to death in so many other games. I'd prefer if the company actually focuses more on co-op elements. Instead, we get a co-op mode that offers only one achievement, and none for even completing the story modes with the help of a friend.

On the topic of achievements, those who enjoy unlocking them (like me) will have mixed reactions to the list. A large portion of it is dedicated to completing missions, while some are for completing the above-mentioned movie-specific key moments. A sizaeble part of it is also listed for kills achieved as various classes. For those who honestly dislike playing competitive online matches, these could be a turn-off (although you could always ""boost"" them with a friend...). You also don't get the achievement points for chapter completions if you play through the game with a friend, which is mystifying. In games like this, I usually play co-op right away with a friend. As far as possible, I try to avoid playing alone whenever co-op is available. But I've to now, because the game refuses to acknowledge that I've completed a chapter just because I've played it with a friend.

All in all, LOTR: Conquest is an ok game that has its moments, but falls short on other areas. Nevertheless, it does offer the chance to revisit one of the greatest movie trilogies ever made. For this, I'd recommend that you at least pick it up for a try.

the characters are interesting but the story seemed rushed but at the same time, LONG and GRUELING. they focus on things that don't really need to be focused on. and the whole thing felt like it was a prototype for the rest of the games that came after it. i played Tales of Symphonia before i played this so i don't know which came out first. but i can tell you i like the feel of ToS better than ToL.

it's 2D fighting in the battle field. and monsters attack you RANDOMLY they don't run the screen like in other Tales of Games i've played. you could literally run Three Steps and be attacked my a monster. the only time the monsters are visible are in actual dungeons.

<_< oh yeah, and the names were bad too senel Coolidge? norma? really? i am not making this up.

the sound effects (on normal settings) and any voices in the game (save Grune and Raynard) were unnecessarily loud.

all and all id have to give this a tree only because there was alot of this game that got on my nerves. the battle lay out the slow but rushed story line where they gave you too much information on something not relevant but not enough on something you needed. (okay, go fight this guy... why? because he's evil... this rock is an ancient rock passed down from the Goddesses to the humans millions of years ago if you set it on fire... that sort of thing.) the voice acting was slow and bad and i'm sure you'll spend more time pressing x to get through the cut scenes than actually watching them (god knows i wanted to).  but the voice acting would have been on the back burner for me if it was just the minor skits but it's the major skits and cut seens that take up a LARGE ten percent of the game. the other 89percent is spent making different types of bread to carry around which you can only carry fifteen in total. not fifteen different kinds, just fifteen. five Bagles with lox, five pizzas three bread loaves a pie and a sandwich (really?) yes really. i'm half dead i have no apple gels left the onlything that will keep me from dying is a loaf of bread... >_> sure why not.

I don't care so much about light sourcing or smoke effects in the games I play; I want games that are well-polished and fun to play.  Too many PS/2 games are relying on good graphics to carry the day.
Unfortunately, the Wipeout Fusion designers seem to have focused more on the dust and smoke and less on the game itself.
The graphics are OK.  The resolution is noticeably better than in the PSone (of course), but there are noticeable popup effects and framerate problems as well.  (In bad cases I've seen the framerate slow to what appears to be less than 5 frames a second.  Wip3out at its worst was better than this.)
The gameplay itself also has significant problems.  The first noticable issue is that it's tough to compare the different ships--unlike the first two games, each ship is on a separate screen and the various statistics aren't directly comparable.  Not a huge problem, but it struck me right away as something easily fixable but quite annoying... especially as some of the more advanced ship descriptions are less than helpful.
There are also some big clipping problems.  I've gotten my ship blown through walls, mountains, rocks, you name it. The game recovers cleanly, and sometimes it's even an advantage (depending on where you can be placed back onto the track) but again, it's annoying.  I can't recall this sort of problem ever happenign in Wipeout XL/3...  Maybe the designers considered this to be a feature, but I haven't found it so, especially as the ship often ends up in very strange places and can even get trapped.
Some of the new weapons exacerbate the clipping issues.  One of them (gravity bomb) gives your ship a high acceleration before stopping it dead, and the high acceleration causes a lot of the clipping issues.  (It also has a very large area of effect, which I can't say is a feature either.)
Another annoying feature is that the CPU ships have access to all the weapons, including the ones that they weren't allowed to use in Wipeout XL/Wip3out.  I've lost many races because five or six trailing enemy ships decided to release Quake at the same time, and there's no defence; you lose.  Ditto with Gravity Bomb or some of the other area-effect weapons.  The enemy ships also have eyes in the back of their heads, as they're amazingly skilled at blocking your ship.
None of this would matter so much except for the structure of the league races, where losing one race can make all the difference between earning an overall first place finish and not--and you have to come in first to advance.  I'm also not that thrilled with the whole credit system for upgrading ships, as it just requires playing the league series over and over and over and over...blah.
Finally...it just doesn't feel anything like the originals.  The physics are strikingly different; it's almost a totally different game than the first two.  I also miss the Designers Republic influence on the game, and I'm totally missing the point about the big heads (er, sorry,pilots), as there's no real personality behind them.  And why would anyone find looking at preliminary sketches of the artwork interesting?  That's a pretty crummy extra.
In short: it feels about 3/4 finished.  I hate to judge it against the first two, because of course it's allowed to be its own game, but I'd give it about 50% for the effort. They should've called it something other than Wipeout, and really finished the game before releasing it.","sigh, what a shame...",1025568000,17,,

I have had a lot of PC titles, and a couple Wii titles.  This one is well...a bit better than ok, but not what I would classify as good.  Yes I play it, and enjoy it to a point, but it gets a bit borning after an hour or so.  Now I'm comparing this based on my favorite title to date (Fishing Resort) and my least favorite (Rapala Tournement Fishing).  The characters are very cartoonish (no big deal here- except why do all the choices look like punks?).  The fish splashing in the water are kinda stupid looking, and the casting seems hit or miss (I cast out 94 feet and get no comment, but on a 73 foot cast I get an amazing comment?)  No my real (haha or shoud I say REEL) issue is in the fighting of the fish.  THe response time is insanenly slow, that stupid combo flipping thing is just plain well stupid, and often times I only touch the reel button once or twice and the fish is in.  Yea this part of the game is a dud (and isn't the whole point of a fishing game to reel in your catch).  There is way too much talking in it (no biggie- just a minor annoyance) and that stupid cell phone thingie gets old after the second e-mail.  Now I do like the companion dog (or cat) and the fact that they actully do something.  I like the bait selection, rod selection portion too.  The scenery is nice, but why am I confined to such a small area? I will probably play to a point in this title then just drop it.  I bought it used at a good price so I have no regrets there.

450192,3.0,False,"10 17, 2003",A3ME62ZG7A27KD,B00004SV2B,Aussiemystic,"Perhaps the best aspect of this game is its visuals - an expansive and detailed visualisation of the Tower of London, right down to the souvenirs on sale in the gift shop.  I've never been to the real Tower and so can't vouch for its accuracy, but the game certainly provides a realistic graphical environment.  Most of the locations you can visit are not essential for completion of the game, but add to colour.  There are secret passages and rambling corridors galore.
The game is also far from straightforward.  Some may see this as a plus, others a minus.  Your mission is to steal - well, actually 'borrow' - three of the Crown Jewels, and replace them with fakes fitted with tracking devices so that another operative cannot steal them.  There is a time limit, so you have to make your moves count (keep saving your game, and replay key scenes if necessary).  You start with a small inventory but quickly pick up a large number of items - both tools of the trade, and various keys and items lying around the Tower.  This can sometimes lead to long sessions trying many different inventory items to see which one works.
From soon after the start you can visit most places in the Tower.  This can be irritating as the Tower is filled with information (literally dozens of tourist information boards, books, paintings, items etc) and a couple of these contain vital information for completing the game - but which ones?  It's a laborious process to photograph and read all the information boards in the hope that you will strike it lucky.  Similarly, despite you having some interesting equipment (such as a grappling hook and ropelift) there are only a couple of limited locations where you can use it, which it will probably take you a looooong time to find without a walkthrough.  This means the game is not open to creative solutions, despite the Tower location potentially providing many opportunities.  There's a lot of guesswork rather than deduction involved.
Unfortunately for such a potentially exciting story, gameplay is ponderous.  I found new locations slow to load, and although there is much tracking back and forth there is no 'zip' mode to enable you to navigate quickly through scenes.  In addition, the game comes on four CDs which need to be swapped often throughout as there is no full install option.
The game will keep you occupied for a while but although the locations are well detailed they lack the wonder of (say) the locations in Myst or other more fantasy-based games.  There is also a lack of much action (you can't let yourself be seen by any of the guards) and the plodding pace of the game engine is irritating.  I often return to the Myst series just to marvel at the astounding visuals, but I can't see that happening with this game.",Lavishly detailed but not very exciting,1066348800,2,,

345887,3.0,False,"07 1, 2014",AHNSLK2JYSY4M,B00IGI3G3G,Jermain J.,"Fans of the past Cybertron games will be pleased to hear that RotDS retains their signature gameplay mechanics. Transforming from robot to vehicle mode and back is still performed with a simple click of the left thumb stick. It still feels pretty cool to transform on the fly in the midst of the games many action packed encounters and take the fight to your enemies in vehicle form thanks to the controls retaining their responsiveness and fluidity.

Just like in Fall of Cybertron, each Transformer has their own unique special ability equipped to help them stand out a little more gameplay wise; from Sideswipes grappling hook to Sharphots cloaking, each adds a little more variety to the combat. Players can also carry two weapons at a time; 1 primary and 1 heavy, as well as equip and utilize T.E.C.H. (Transformers Electronic Combat Hardware) items during combat. These items when consumed, offer a range off offensive and defensive counter measures; such as clearing large groups of enemies via miniature black hole or summoning a drone to heal and repair you.

With over twenty weapons to choose from (Which can be upgraded), the game is not short on variety and blasting your foes into oblivion is still fun. Sadly there aren't any new weapons or T.E.C.H items and with the exception of Drifts cool Blade Dash ability, fans have seen it all before. In short at its core, RotDS still pretty much feels and plays like a High Moon Transformers title.

Those worried about this game suffering from Me too syndrome, will be glad to know that Edge of Reality added some new bells and whistles to deliver a fresh experience. Rise of the Dark Spark features a persistent leveling up system that is tracked in both the single player campaign and co-op mode (More on that in a bit). Players level up by earning experience points (XP) for killing their enemies in any mode, completing various challenges such as getting this many kills with a specific weapon, and earning Combat Distinctions (Accolades).

Another new addition are the gear boxes; rewards earned for performing the aforementioned tasks. Opening the boxes will unlock new playable characters for co-op, weapons, upgrades, T.E.C.H, HACKS and abilities. The gear boxes are broken up into tiers; ranging from bronze to prime. The better the box, the better the content and the more you get. It is all randomized though, so expect to receive a lot of duplicates of things you can only have one of such as a Transformer. Instead of going to waste however, the duplicate unlocks are converted into HACKS of which players can have an infinite amount of. It is worth noting that with the exception of abilities and Transformers, whatever you unlock from the gear boxes can be used in all modes. Unlocked a new weapon and an upgrade for it? Well that bad boy can be used in campaign and in co-op. Its a nice touch and a welcomed addition to the series, though an option to skip through your rewards each time you open a gear box. It becomes rather troublesome and annoying to have to sit each and every unlock.

Speaking of HACKS, if players are looking for more of a challenge then they can equip these special items. Similar to the Skulls from the Halo franchise, they add increased difficulty by removing the HUD (Heads Up Display), causing enemies to deal more damage and more. While they are active, players will receive an increase in the amount of XP earned. These new features do result in bot blasting feeling more rewarding than previous games but ultimately they aren't enough to elevate the games campaign over its predecessors.

The epic feel and huge sense of scale seen in Transformers: FoC is notably absent, and while the dialogue and voice acting are pretty solid, the games plot is a rather forgettable one. All you really need to know is that the Transformers are battling over a powerful time manipulating energy source called the Dark Spark. On Earth the Autobots must retrieve the Dark Spark from the robot Mercenary Lockdown, while on Cybertron millions of years before players experience the events that lead to its eventual arrival on Earth as the Transformers fight for its possession. This is meant to be what ties the two universes together in one continuity. Though it never really fully explains if High Moons Cybertron Transformers and Micheal Bays (Which are what the Earth versions are based on) exist within the same timeline or are in separate universes all together, as the possibility of the dark spark originating from another one is alluded to.

The chapters based on Cybertron are the campaigns strongest thanks to overall level design, mission structure and aesthetics, though the games outdated graphics hurt their visual appeal. Since this is a movie tie-in, the Earth missions do make up the fames final levels and while they aren't bad they just are not as fun. The final battle against Lockdown was rather disappointing compared to the boss battles in the previous games. Not a single boss fight had that Epic feel to them. The games final chapters felt rushed in fact the entire game while fun, was obviously rushed so it could release alongside the new film.

Even though the campaign never manages to reach the heights of the past games, Edge of Reality does deliver a slightly revamped and improved Escalation mode. Escalation is 4 player cooperative survival mode in which players must survive wave after wave of increasingly difficult enemies and has been a staple in the series since War for Cybertron. This time around players can now personalize their own custom loadout; choosing their preferred Autobot and Decepticon (Over 40), weapons, ability, T.E.C.H. (Up to 3) and even equip a HACK. As stated before anything unlocked while playing campaign can also be used in this mode.

The biggest change to Escalation is the inclusion of upgradable defenses. Defeated enemies drop energon shards for players to pick up. These shards act as a form of currency and can be used to activate turrets, healing stations, barricades and more. The shards can also be used to purchase upgrades for the defenses which adds a new layer of strategy to the mode. Do you focus on spending all your shards on that turret, its upgrades and keeping it repaired? Or do you split them up among as many defenses as you can.

Dont expect to just rely on these defense and your weapons to win the day, as you must work together with your teammates in order to emerge victorious. The enemies do not relent and while the first few waves are a bit of a cakewalk, but the later ones are down right tough especially if all four players have HACKS equipped. With only three respawn lives shared between the entire team, the game can end quickly if one or two players decide to be the lone wolf. Stick close to your buddies, revive one another and spend your energon shards wisely.

Escalation mode is a blast, especially when playing with friends or people who actually understand the meaning of cooperative play, but it isn't perfect. Occasionally enemies will refuse to come out of their spawn point, and on certain maps where they spawn from above. If you don't have someone on your team with a Transformer than can fly, then you can forget about reaching him and pray he eventually comes out of hiding otherwise the round won't end. Speaking of maps Escalation features 8, a mixture of Earth and Cybertronian levels. Much like the campaign, the Earth based maps are the least impressive.

Fans looking for a more competitive Transformers experience will have to look elsewhere as online versus multiplayer was not include in RotDS. It is a rather baffling notion because to this day you can still find players in Transformers: FoC multiplayer. After listening to fan feedback for their first game, High Moon delivered a much improved mp including a feature many fans had asked for; more customization options for creating their own Transformers. Removing it is a big slap in the face and just adds to the overall feeling of this game being rushed.

Final Verdict:

Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark is a solid entry in the video game series but it fails to outdo its predecessors. It features a pretty decent campaign, an improved co-op experience and a variety of welcomed new features especially the persistent leveling system and the upgradable defenses. Unfortunately the outdated graphics, throwaway plot, lack of Epic single player moments, the glaring omission of a competitive and overall rushed feeling hurt this title. Rise of the Dark Spark feels like the Batman: Arkham Origins of the Transformers series.

So if you buy a used copy of the Legendary Edition you are basically overpaying for a basic Destiny disc and will not have access to any of the expansions.

I played a little bit of the new Taken King content and the game has improved somewhat. The cutscene was pretty decent and there is an attempt to tell more of a story. The drop rate seems better now but I dislike how most of my year one legendary and exotic stuff (weapons, armor, ghost shell, hunter capes, etc) is now garbage compared to commons and uncommons. Very few year one exotics items can be upgraded with legendary marks. I used to play Destiny daily when it first came out and did so for several months. I quit playing around the time the second raid hit and never regretted leaving the game behind. Then I discovered Warframe and after playing that, it is almost painful to go back to Destiny. Everything about the movement in Destiny is so slow and it's like the game designers want you to use your power once every 20 minutes or something. I am spoiled by Warframe where I can spam powers non-stop if I choose.

I have not played Dead Reefs because the reviews say it's buggier than an entymologist's den.  Disregard the ratings above because I would rate each game so differently.  Also, I would buy it again, if only for two of the games.

1.  Keepsake:  The visuals were gorgeous; the puzzles were interesting, with a few of the usual puzzles thrown in.  The storyline was stupid.  We're in a school of magic!  Wizards, dragons, you know!  Could we have a little action, please?  How about a real bad guys?  And frankly, Celeste got on my nerves.

2.  Return to Mysterious Island:  Visually okay, but I really, really loved loved loved the fact that puzzles had more than one solution.  I played it twice just to try things differently.  I've always hated the fact that you can be standing over a bomb, needing the wire cutters, and going to die because you only have a pair of scissors.  In real life, you wreck the scissors, get a little shock, and live.  Story line was a little thinner than usual, but the flexibility of the game made it one of my favorites in this pack.  Only one pixel hunt I can think of.

3.  Nibiru:  This game reminds me of Eastern European films:  Grim, humorless, inflexible, and giving me a lot less agency than I am used to.  Not a coincidence--it's based on an Eastern European game.  Too much walk and talk.  Storyline could have been interesting, if it didn't insist on being so noir.  At least it wasn't buggy.  It was beautiful, though.  Points for using Nazis without falling into sterotypes.

4.  Tunguska--we enjoyed this one.  Humor, action, and a great button.  You push on it and you can see all the ""hot spots"" on the screen.  No more pixel hunting.  Good storyline.  We await the sequel.  I think if you like Broken Sword, you'll like Tunguska.",Game by game,1216166400,13,,

Only thing is that you HAVE to file it down a little because the plug is a little bit bigger than the part where you have to insert it.

They AI was good and the time slowdown effect was a nice hook.  FEAR2 feels like a lesser version rather than an enhancement.  It's also shorter.

The story is a bit harder to follow than the first, which wasn't really all that easy, but they feed you enough you'll get it...you may not care.  The AI seems much dumber than the past one.  At times they literally lined up to run single file into my gun as I blasted away.

The Bad: Empty world, boring driving, not much in vehicle variety, story is uninteresting, unintuitive level editor, just plain boring

OK Far Cry was in the day was a great technical feat and that's pretty much it. Far Cry had a lot of AI problems with enemies being able to see you miles away, you needed a monster computer to run it, it had almost no story, and was pretty repetitive. Unfortunately, Far Cry 2 follows all these trends again, but with better graphics, a setting in Africa, an even more confusing story, a super confusing level editor, and the same bland boring huge open world. Now I'm not saying Far Cry 2 is bad I'm just saying it needs more filling because there is way to much crust on this one.

The game starts out great with you in the back of a car driving to the guerrilla's headquarters. Once you get through the tutorial you're thrown into the beautiful yet empty world trying to find ""The Jackal"" who is feeding both rival gangs guns and fuel (APR and UFLL). You can work for either side since you need either or to get to The Jackal. For starters, the game has lots and lots of guns and you can upgrade them by using diamonds (finding diamonds cases and/or completing missions) you can buy the weapons for infinite ammo in your save rooms, you can buy manuals which increase accuracy, reliability, etc. You can also buy equipment that will let you hold more ammo, more health, more stimpaks etc. There's lots here and everything is fairly priced, but you earn diamonds so slowly it takes forever to get enough.

When you're actually shooting the guns feel great, but another problem carried over from the first one is that these guys never die. You'll pump a whole clip in these guys and some times they'll still be standing. Some times your gun will jam and you have to mash X to get it unstuck and if you're really unlucky you're whole gun will break and then you're SOL. Getting the reliability upgrades fixes this and swapping out weapons from fallen foes helps this a lot. Far Cry 2 also has a ""buddy system"" which are aqcuired by completing missions, and these so called buddies can save you in battle (if you run out of health...think of it as an extra life), they can help make missions easier by offering alternatives. This is a great system and is probably the only great game play idea in Far Cry 2 that isn't boring or doesn't piss you off. When you do get low on health you can pry bullets out of yourself, wrap yourself in bandages, and even poke yourself with magic needles. You can refill these at health boxes in random areas or one of your save houses. You unlock new save houses by killing all guards in the area and bam there you go.

The next game play element that is from the first game and was bizarrely stripped down is the vehicles you drive. There are only maybe five in the whole game and those are a Jeep, a car, an assault truck, and a couple of boats. When your vehicle gets banged up and starts smoking you can hop out and repair it to new which is great, but even if the car starts smoking a little bit it runs very slowly...LAME. Now to get to the most annoying part of the game...the constant back tracking. I understand this is an open world game (I love sandbox games don't get me wrong), but Far Cry 2 fails at this. First off the map they give you is horrible since it's a little piece of paper you hold (next to your GPS) and all the dots look like blobs so the legend is useless. You'll travel to a missions on one side of the map finish it then have to navigate all the way back to town. You can't really go off the trails since there are so many mountains, rocks, tress blocking your path unless you run on foot.

Then this is where the meat of annoyance comes in; there's nothing in between all of this driving around! Maybe here and there you'll see an animal, but all you get are the same thugs coming after you in their vehicles from the guard posts plastered all along the trails. That is really ALL there is between driving from mission to mission. The missions are exactly the same, maybe you'll have to save a friend (or shoot him/her), but essentially it's all the same.

The malaria effect was useless and made things even more annoying. Every so often you'll have to take a malaria pill and if you run out you have to go to the ends of the Earth (ok Africa!) to get more or you die. Essentially this makes the game boring and I got a headache every time I played this. Now if you like sandbox games where there is hardly a story, and you just drive around killing random thugs then go ahead have at it. Now this brings me to the level editor which is deep, but there's no tutorial and it is NOT user friendly. Lastly, the only exciting thing is multi player. The best part of Far Cry 2 are the graphics; the game is gorgeous with free flowing grass, everything burns, trees break when under fire, the lighting is beautiful it just all looks so good, but the game play is just not there. Sorry Ubisoft maybe Far Cry 3 will fix all of these issues.",Far Cry 2 is essentially quite boring,1332892800,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

(PLEASE NOTE: this review is for the cable while using a PS3, I did not have a wii to test it with)

I bought this because I am deployed and I didn't want to have to buy an hdtv when I already have a 19' monitor I use for my laptop. I was pleasantly suprised at all the subtle features included with this cable. It came with a gender adapter for the cable which was a lifesaver for me because I didn't want to have to unplug the cable everytime I switched between my PS3 and Laptop. Also notable is the extension cables for the audio which even includes a headphone jack! (brilliant inclusion as far as im concerned because I can play my PS3 without waking people up!) And now the bad parts: Right away my biggest peeve was the installation. It requires you to hook the cable to a tv and your pc monitor silmantaneously when you first install it. This is frustrating mainly because they give you very little cable slack between the av plug and the vga plug. I was forced to hold the tv up with one hand and adjust the settings because I couldn't make the cords reach between the tv and monitor otherwise. And now the Ugly: Theoretically this adapter can support all the way up to 1080P. But because it is only a cable and it doesnt have its own dedicated box your images look a little washed out, the picture was also dark on both monitors I tried even after I adjusted brightness and contrast, and worst of all you have to adjust the screen with your monitor controls to make the image fit properly... something you will be doing almost every time you insert a different game or movie. 720p Gave me the best results on the two monitors I tried this cable with. (19 and 21 inch lcd monitors)

PROS:
-Cheap Solution For a Hi-Def Experience
-99% Artifact Free Image
-Inclusion of gender adapter was a nice courtesy
-Headphone jack a much appreciated add-on
-Great Value Considering you can use this for PS3 and WII

CONS:
-Image appears a little washed out, Though still noticeably improved over the regular AV cable.
-Lack of Dedicated box means you will be rescaling the image manually...often...
-Initial setup is clunky and frustrating.
-Even after adjusting you are sometimes forced to let parts of the screen be cut off.

OVERALL:

I was slightly dissapointed with the overall package. I have owned a vga adapter for Dreamcast as Well as XBX360 and both would beat the snot out of this cable. The fact that I had to manually adjust my picture every time it changed resolutions wasn't just frustrating but seemed ridiculous to me. However on the same token I am enjoying my ps3 games in high def without having to spend moolah on an hdtv. With this cable it was easy for me to switch between my stereo system or a pair of headphones which is convenient. Overall it was a decent buy for the price, but I hope some other company (or god forbid Sony themselves!) will step up and release something better in the future. Get it if you cant afford an hdtv or are short on space, etc. But if you have an hdtv handy, just spring for the official Sony Component Cables, youll be much happier I promise.","Great Design, a Few Flaws (PS3)",1219449600,50,,

But both of us agreed this game was JUST TOO HARD.  It's a terrific idea---you draw Pacmen to eat up ghosts.  The Pacmen go in the direction you drew them---bigger ones go slower, littler ones faster.  Sometimes you have to drive them over locks and then you can make them go up to the top screen of the DS for bonus points.  It's neat because they get littler up there, but keep their same basic shape, then they come down bigger and keep eating!  You can draw walls to keep them from walking off the screen, as you only have a limited amount of Pacmen for each level.  At higher levels, you can also draw arrows and bombs.

We played this for a quite a while, but hit a wall about about section 1, level 5 (that's not the technical term, but there are many sections each with many levels, so you get the idea!)  You can't skip levels, so we just tried over and over and over and just could NOT do it.  At one point you have to eat ghosts in order, first 1 then 2 then 3.  The ghost are very close together and you have to shoot them with arrows apart, then eat them.  All this is within a short time limit and with limited pacmen and with needing to draw them well enough to be recognized as such...Well, I felt like crying after a bit!  And I am closing in on 40 fast---I can imagine how kids feel.

I find this problem with many video games.  They seem to be aimed at high end games, and ignore the fact that much of their audience are KIDS---some of which are fairly good but others of which are not.  My thoughts are that the professional reviewers ARE good, and those are the ones the games are made to impress---after all, once you've bought the game, they don't make more if you actually can PLAY it!","Cool idea, but VERY HIGH frustration level!",1121990400,11,,
22491,3.0,False,"08 14, 2005",AF3RMNRNRSG7W,B00005BIQK,Brynn Huxtable,"When I heard that yet another expansion pack for Half-Life was about to be released, I snaffled a copy as soon as I could. And as I thought, ""Half-life: Blue Shift,"" did not disappoint in terms of graphics, gameplay, excitement and fun. BUT the problem is that you can finish this Expansion in 5 hours on the Difficult setting! Now I live in South Africa and I payed R250 (that's about $42) for it. Then I discovered why it was/is so expensive: 1) it includes the retail version of ""Opposing Force,"" and 2) the Half-Life High-Definition pack. So of course I went and played the entire series with the new H.D pack and it was great! So I suppose if you were buying ""Blue Shift"" by itself it wouldn't be worth it. BUT (again) I already had the retail version of ""Opposing Force,"" and the return offer for ""Opposing Force"" was only open to Canada and the U.S.A. SO bummer for me for not being in the northern hemisphere YET AGAIN! Well, all that aside, here's my take on ""Blue Shift.""

In this Expansion pack you assume the role of Barney Calhoun, a Security Guard at Black Mesa. Just like Gordon Freeman, you start your day normally with the usual drudge of the auto-tram and suiting up. However, Barney and the entire Black Mesa facility are soon inexplicably thrown into a world of blood-thirsty aliens and merciless and unforgiving soldiers. And of course the only way out is to fight - you can't really fault the storyline as it follows the same type of adventure as the previous 2 installments. And there are new places to explore and different objectives (in some instances), so I guess that ""Blue Shift,"" gets a 9/10 for the story etc.

In terms of difficulty, ""Blue Shift"" is actually very easy. Even on the hardest setting it's a cakewalk, and for seasoned F.P.S players and ""Half-Life"" fans, this game will no doubt be a walk in the park. No new enemies or weapons either (bummer!), so in terms of new weapons, ""Blue Shift,"" gets 2/10 (because the MP5 changes to an M4 Assault Rifle when you apply the H.D. pack, so nothing really ""new"" I'm afraid). In terms of difficulty, it's 2/10 for Easy, 4/10 for Normal and 5/10 for Hard. Just trust me, the game is not very challenging and will most likely be a frag-fest for most gamers, and there's never a shortage of ammo (unless you're a trigger-happy freak!) so ""Blue Shift,"" just ain't a challenge my friends.

The characters you encounter include Scientists, soldiers, and various aliens that you've probably seen a thousand times. So no points for ""Blue Shift,"" on that level. As a Security Guard you will now need to use helmets and body armour to keep yourself safe instead of H.E.V and P.V.C chargers like Gordon Freeman and Adrian Shephard. In this way there's a new approach to protecting yourself, which is a refreshing change. You won't fight the more advanced, powerful aliens as Shephard did and you won't encounter any Desert Eagles, Sniper Rifles, S.A.W's or anything cool like that. In some ways ""Blue Shift,"" is a regression, but nonetheless, it's still fun as hell and action is fast, realistic and furious! 10/10 for Gameplay!

Overall ""Half-Life: Blue Shift,"" scores a comfortable 3.5/5 or 7/10 if you like. My personal advice is that if you want value for money, this probably isn't worth it. If you're looking for a real challenge, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a huge expansion pack, well, ""Opposing Force"" is bigger, but that's it. If you just wanna kill s***, frag, run, jump and play with the all-new H.D pack (on all Half-Life games) and are a ""Half-Life"" fan, then you should already have this game. I'm reluctant to just say ""buy it."" That's what I've found and what others have agreed upon, so you be the judge.

Sure, it had it's issues, like clunky, unresponsive combat, some poor voice acting, and some tired puzzles, but I am a huge Saw fan and it had everything that I wanted from it and more. When I heard that Saw II: Flesh & Blood was being developed, I was excited, cause I trusted Konami to improve on the issues from the first game and bring us a more polished and more enjoyable gaming experience on their second attempt.

Sadly, I was wrong.

I just have one BIG question that I wish I could ask the developers: WHAT HAPPENED? This game doesn't improve on any of the issues from the first game, in fact, it makes some of them worse! Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy the game, but I find that I am only playing it to beat it so I can see where the story is going to go.

The biggest issue with this game is the same as the first game- combat. While the combat in the first game was clunky and unresponsive, it was still tense and could have been great if they'd kept that system for this game and fixed the bugs. But they didn't. Instead, what we got here is a completely new combat system consisting of- be prepared- QUICK TIME EVENTS. Who thought that was a good idea? There is no fear or terror in the combat because no matter what, you can't be surprised by somebody just coming up behind you and attacking you and that kills the sometimes tense atmosphere that this game could create. Plus, no matter what the weapon is, every weapon is one battle, one use, so you're constantly on the lookout for something- anything- to use as a weapon. It really drags down the overall value of this game and might make some people not want to come back to it.

Another big issue that I have noticed is the delay in transition between gameplay and cinematic event. Often, you'll enter a room and stand around for several seconds before a cut scene starts playing, and the next time you go through that area, it'll trigger instantly. This wouldn't be such a big deal if it were only a once or twice occasion but it's not, it seems to happen every hour of gameplay or so. Another issue I have noticed is that sometimes the audio doesn't play at all, especially during the scene involving Tapp and another character in a cage where Jigsaw has a monologue and you can see the subtitles, but there is no sound, and there never has been anytime I have gone through that area. The checkpoints are few and far between, and some of the puzzles are downright diabolical, such as the polarized circuit breaker puzzles. Also, half the time there is no indication of how to solve the puzzle and it's often just blind, pure luck that you manage to save a character (such as how I managed to save Carla.)

However, the atmosphere and the environments are well done from an aesthetic point of view. I only occasionally notice crummy textures or bland detail, and the character models, on occasion, can look really great. Trap design is about as good as it was in the first one, and the tension has increased when you open a door and now have to hit two buttons instead of one to avoid having your head blown off by a shotgun. There are a few frustrating enemies, but none that will make you want to split the disc in half. The game is fun and the story is great, but there are going to be times in the game where you get incredibly frustrated and just don't want to keep playing anymore. Also, be prepared to die quite often and have to go back to before you completed a puzzle and complete it again. But, in my opinion, despite all the flaws, it's still worth playing through just to have another piece of the Saw universe to explore, if you are, like me, a big Saw fan. If you're not a Saw fan, then you should probably stay clear of this game because I guarantee you won't like it.",What happened?????,1298332800,2,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

It's huge and has a ton of quests, the vast majority being optional. However I found the majority of the quests, and I did them nearly all of them, to be boring and tedious. It's mostly fetch this or kill that. Vary few of the quests have any kind of an intriguing storyline.

There is very little significant NPC interaction, and the graphics of people are repetitive and somewhat cartoonish. There is very little choice on how you complete quests.

The map is huge and there's plenty to find, but you can spend hours playing this game and accomplish nothing.
You have to design your character well at the beginning, based on the skills you will use or you will never level up. This is hard, because you do not know, if you are new to the game, what skills you are going to be using.
The combat is largely hack and slash with no real difference between weapons. The weapons and armor are largely repetitive and just different versions of each other.

I bought this to use with the Genesis Flashback instead of using the controllers it came with that need batteries. The cord is plenty long, the D pad works good, and so does the mode and ABC buttons. However, when I was playing Greatest Heavyweights, the X and Z buttons seemed to have between a 30% to 40% failure rate when pressed. Many times I would block, then try to do an uppercut with X or Z and my character would just stand there waiting to get punched.

After seeing all the glowing reviews from the PC world for a year now, and seeing all the high praise after it was released on the 360, I expected a great game.  This is probably going to be the biggest gaming disappointment of the year for me (or at least I hope there aren't any more).

I dumped just over 4 hours into this game, but I just can't bring myself to waste another hour hoping it will get better when there are so many other games that are probably fun from the start.

The worst part about this game is the actual action/gameplay.  It feels cumbersome and frustrating.  The other equally bad aspect of this game, as noted by other reviewers is the horrible map/directions system.  I spent too much time running around wondering where so and so was or where to pickup this thing I needed.

All the way back from the heyday of DAoC to all the expansions of WoW, with stops along the way at various others which held my interest for shorter periods of time.  When TOR came out, it was a no-brainer to purchase.  I'd played and loved both KOTOR games, and BioWare is one of the two best RPG makers currently on the market, the other being Blizzard.

As a RPG, this game is solid.  The sheer volume of voice acting is mind boggling, and the stories, while not spectacular, do hold together well.  It takes a satisfying amount of time to complete.  I played through a solo character to 50, and another character to 50 with my brother, doing all of the Heroics/Flashpoints along the way.  I had a good time with both, and don't regret the time I put in for one second.  I would absolutely buy this game again without a second thought.

That being said, the MMO part of this game has some issues.  When I started my character with my brother, we chose a low-pop server to avoid the queues that were prevalent at the time.  Let me tell you, we didn't know how low pop it was going to be.  The server was pretty darn close to deserted the entire time we leveled, rarely did we see more than two or three other players on the same planet as us.  Our server was literally the most deserted server I've ever played on in any MMO.  BioWare didn't allow for character transfers either, which didn't help; and they kept saying server merges ""may"" one day be an option.  If I log on Friday night and the total players on the Republic side of my server is stuck in the double digits, that's just terrible and I shouldn't have to wait for BioWare to figure out how the heck to fix it.  Yes, of course, I can start other characters on other servers- losing all my legacy points.  Plus, leveling is not nearly as fun the third or fourth time through.  The voice acting which was amazing the first or second time through is just repetitive on the third go-round.

Overall, it's a good RPG.  As for the MMO part, well, that remains to be seen.  I've cancelled my subscription for now, and Diablo is calling my name.  After that addiction runs its course I may come back to TOR depending on what BioWare has done with it.","Great RPG, meh MMO",1335052800,7,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

I remember playing through portions of Need for Speed: Most Wanted and enjoyed trying to evade the cops in a semi-open world style game. I bought this game loving Burnout Paradise and expecting great things from a cops vs. racers game.

How can you not expect great things? Burnout Paradise played like a dream and looked good. Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit looks even better. The graphical detail of the cars is drool worthy and the scenery is so absolutely gorgeous that it takes your breath away. If this game was a game where you went around driving for fun and looked at the amazing beautiful scenery then it'd be half way to being a successful game. This game just looks phenomenal, the graphics are wonderful.

Hot Pursuit doesn't handle nearly as well as Burnout Paradise--the various cars handle differently often either too tight or too loose.  The engine running this game changes up the way the cars feel and how you control them.  I can't put my finger on what's different or why it doesn't feel right, but they're not as easy to control as burnout paradise. There's no adjustment on controls sensitivity that I could find, and that hurt my overall rating of this title.

I've read some people complaining about the music. You can play your own playlists from your own music collection on your PS3, so if you don't like the music simply put on some music from your own collection.

It should be noted that I don't have any online friends, so I was unable to benefit from the autolog and competitive online friends features that seem to drive Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit.  I'm sure that hurt my opinion of the game, but I'm not a huge online multiplayer-more of a single player person.

But my biggest complaint with this game is that is simply lacks in that cops and street racers feel to it. Ok, don't get me wrong, there are cops and racers in this game and that's what this game advertises to be all about.  But nearly half the events are a sort of time trial whether you're a racer or a police officer. Even when you're a racer you don't always run into the police cars during races. When you race a time trial as a cop even if you bump even the slightest part of the wall the game penalizes you. If you don't manage to find the right short cuts and never crash into anything, you'll never have a chance at even a silver on these time trial events.

Even when you do run into opposition, it often feels lame, the Police barricades have a huge hole in the middle of them, the spike strips (which seems effective in concept) are hard to release properly but can be difficult to miss when you're the victim of one.  The other weapons are ok, but not great and not exciting.

These various things add up to a rather disappointing need for speed game unless you're looking for another predictable albeit beautiful arcade racer with cop pursuit elements tossed in an over-the-top fun fashion.

Almost everyone would've forgotten that the 3rd part of the life disc is in the volacanno area of the fire relm, because we were there half the game ago. And then, after the life relm is done, the oracles speech doesn't change. So how are you supposed to find the death relm? It doesn't give you any clues.

That said, this game was a good way to spend 40+ hours for my money.  I enjoyed the scenery, the combat system doesn't take you long to get ahold of, and the slow addition of characters lets you work up to managing all four of their attacks and special abilities at once.

The storyline seemed a little contrived, not surpising for a handheld rpg.  The ""blade dancer"" himself arrives on the island to ""test his skills"".  Right.  The arguments he has with various villains throughout the game are sometimes childish and cliched all to hell, but very occasionally some dry humor comes through.  It's very welcome when it's there.

My biggest (and for the most part only) complaint is how much running back and forth you must do in this game, often painstakingly trying to figure out what mysterious hoop you have to jump through to move on.

At one point it was extremely clear where I had to go to advance the story, but the creature I was to slay didn't show up.  After about four hours (that's a conservative estimate) of trial and error I figured out that a seemingly unrelated side quest had to be done before the monster would appear.  The appearance of helpful portals to jet you around the various areas happens way too late in the game, in my opinion.

The Bad: Combat is clunky and frustrating, same 4 maps and objectives are repeated ad nauseum, overly complex upgrade and creation system

The Vita is a strange system as several developers tried to make various genres a stable on the system. With Monster Hunter clone Soul Sacrifice not exactly bringing about that feat, Freedom Wars is the next game to make the Vita a blockbuster hit for co-op monster slaying fun. Freedom Wars starts out a little strange just like Soul Sacrifice. I didn't understand the game for a while and it seemed just like there was something missing through the whole adventure.

Freedom Wars tries to bring about an interesting anime style post-apocalyptic adventure in which people are all prisoners and sentenced to fight monsters that will destroy settlements unless they have some sort of trait that the government can benefit from. Everyone starts about with a lifetime sentence, but it can get reduced based off of various accomplishments such as donating loot from battle to ""the cause"", fighting monsters, taking part in more missions, and behaving. This is ingrained into the players head from the start as you are sentenced to 1,000 years by walking for too long. Yeah, it's crazy and I loved it. If you run for too long you get your sentenced lengthened so you have to buy an upgrade that allows you to run, talk to other people, and do various other things which are actually quite cool.

One you read your sentence you put your thumb print on it and off you go. Now, the game is very slow to start and this is a huge downfall for these types of games as Soul Sacrifice suffered the same problem. There's a bunch of dialog and back story to get through, a lengthy tutorial -- not just for combat -- and then getting used to controls and getting through missions. It takes over 5 hours just to get into the swing of things and start chipping away missions which are not a good thing. These anime type games always do this from monster slaying to JRPGs and it drives me crazy.

Once you do get into the field you can switch between melee and ranged weapons. The goal is to lock on to enemies and hack away at a weak point, but your special weapon is your grapple which can heal or do damage among various other things. Once you grapple to a weak point you can hack away at it and then the monster falls allowing all bots and yourself to go to town. It only gets fun when you find a momentum and your AI teammates are all getting along and doing their job. You also have an assistant bot that always look out for you that you can customize and assign certain weapons to. Once you fall you can be revived, but if it takes too long you lose a life. If you lose all your lives your sentence is lengthened and your reward for the next turn is reduced making this a tough game towards the end. I was able to whittle away to 4-5 star missions and it started getting ridiculously difficult and repetitive.

Without human teammates, the game becomes frustrating because you can fall in battle and 3 bots are right next to you and won't revive you. There are also issues with the same 3 or 4 maps recycling over and over again and the same missions goals. Save these VIPs, destroy all these monsters etc. It gets really boring towards the 10th hour and I just stopped playing after awhile because I had no reason to go back.

Let's talk about upgrading and creating weapons. This is so complicated and irritating as most of the time you can only upgrade or create something with components you have and it takes quite a few missions to build up a little variety. See, you have to create and build workshops to assign the civilians you save in missions to reduce build time and create things like healing items, weapons, ammo, etc. You can upgrade these buildings sometimes, but in the end, it's all just a bunch of filler and nonsense. Give me a workshop to upgrade and create and leave me alone. It's always so complex and unintuitive with these Japanese games. From JRPGs to action games, all the way to free-to-play mobile games. There's layers upon layers of unnecessary upgrade menus and fusing and defusing etc. It hurts the game quite a bit so I just rely on buying more powerful weapons and upgrading them; I completely skip creating new weapons entirely.

Customizing your character is quite deep as you can buy new color packs, armor, and accessories in the game with points you earn in missions. I enjoyed it quite a bit and it there's a lot of things to customize here so players won't be disappointed. Overall, the game the looks quite good with great lighting effects and textures, probably one of the better looking Vita games out there. There's a lot of detail here and game, it's just a mess and is completely unorganized and unpolished. I feel the developers were trying several different things and couldn't decide on just one. The gameplay is clunky with repetitive missions, recycled maps, and annoying AI bots. The story is nearly non-existent as it takes forever to unfold as you slog through missions after missions just to get a text cut scene. I would love to see a sequel, but seeing as the Vita is slowing dying I doubt that will happen.

Freedom Wars is only for the people who love Soul Sacrifice, Monster Hunter or are really patient and don't mind repetitive combat to get to an ultimate goal. Playing with friends helps, but it doesn't hide the mess and unpolish in this game.","Great concept, not so great execution",1472169600,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation Vita'}",

The nForce2 Chipset shares IRQ's with the USB and Network Controller... so if you are connecting to the Internet through your Ethernet, and enable the Force Feedback on the Joystick in JTL... it causes the ""Drunken Bee Effect"" (commonly discussed on the games Support Forums) to an extreme nature.

nForce2 Boards offer a lot of customizing on the IRQ settings, but the one thing they don't let you do is the ability to the Disable IRQ for USB.

I have tried disabling every device I can think of that uses IRQ's which I am not using on my Mobo.. the Serial and Parrallel Ports, etc... and it is all to no avail.

If I log out of the game, and disable the Force Feedback on the game Options in the game launcher... then log back into the game, the problem goes away.

SOE Tech Support says that, players should go to Logitech and report the problem until Logitech produces a new set of Drivers more compatible with JTL.  Logitech last issued new Software updates for their PC Game Controllers on 4/28/05... and their Force Feedback is still not compatible with Star Wars Galaxies.  It is my opinion though, that the SOE Dev's are just idiots (as usual) and can't produce a game that supports some of the best hardware out there... or they just keep screwing their own games up.

So until either SOE figures out how to support this Joystick, or Logitech figures out how to make it work with just that one game... don't buy it for that game.

However, the suspense of the first game is definitely not as good in the 2nd. There is a LOT of repetition in the 2nd game. Basically go into an area, kill splicers, find little sister, and kill splicers trying to get her. Rinse & repeat- again & again. I also don't like the layout of the levels as much.

The 2nd game there is more open areas where you have to explore many different rooms looking for the predictable events, and it seems like you'll never get to the next level.

It needs some sort of quicksave. The only way to save the game is to:
1. Quit the game your playing.
2. Save the game.
The problem with this is:
1. It takes far too much time.
2. Your never really sure where the last checkpoint was. (i.e. I saved a game today after an hour or so of gameplay on the same level, finally got to a cut scene and then saved. Turned the game on tonight and I'm right back where I started from today.)
Another major problem with the lack of a quicksave is the same problem Tomb Raider had when it first came out. If you die you have to go through the same portion of the game over and over and over and over (tedious isn't it? well, so is this aspect of  the game). This really shouldn't be such a big deal but, it is.
The instruction booklet is a bit vague and I'm not sure about the 500 batmoves that I've seen advertised. Maybe there are that many I just haven't seen them, have no idea how to perform them, or where or how to learn to perform them. Or maybe, ""Batman lifts his left foot and bends his knee and moves his left foot forward and places his left foot on the ground"" counts as four moves, I don't know.
Other than those major flaws the game is playable but not ownable. The graphics are fairly decent and the cinematic cut-scenes are outstanding.

First of all, the graphics are not as high of quality as the other games, especially in the little clips between each level. They're blurry and pixelated, which is not at all up to standards.

The concept of the game is about the same as the others. Go through each level collecting the various items, knuts, etc. in order to get to 100% and purchase characters and red legos. The levels are actually a lot shorter than in the other games, and hardly seem to take up any time at all. This is a bit disappointing, and yes, makes it easier to save the game if you have to do something else, but the other ones have much longer levels, especially since there are only 4 levels per movie in this game.

Another huge disappointment had to be the lack of minigames. Most of the lego games have mini games you can play outside of the levels, and so far I have yet to discover any of them. This is a huge disappointment to me because I actually love the mini games. It's like you get two games for the price of one because you can play the main levels and then play smaller games too. As far as I can tell, this game has none, which is hugely disappointing.

I think this game could have been amazing, but instead they rushed to put something together with the new movie coming out, and yes, the new movie is included in the game as well. If you like the other lego games, you will probably like this one, at least to play and have something decent to do. In my opinion, Harry Potter lego is still the best because the graphics are decent, you use the stylus to conduct spells, and in this one, you don't even need the stylus at all, kind of defeating the whole purpose of it being a Nintendo DS game.",A Bit Disappointing,1305504000,35,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It's my first time getting such a thing and it may be a bad or whatever thing for most people but I think it's good to me. The physical contents it had was interesting, I already knew what I was getting and I was also fully aware what I was paying for and I still don't have regrets. No buyer's remorse for me. The digital contents are pretty good as well. I had a problem getting the digital soundtrack but that was worked out from Bioware's site. Which I was relieved when they finally fixed it for all of us who had the problem of getting the soundtrack. The only downside was that all the tracks were in .WAV files. As if it was extracted from the PC sound files folder and just slap it in, making us think it's THE digital soundtrack. I love the artwork the collector's edition has. From the box to everything that's inside of it and its content, they look real nice.
Okay, so let's review the game itself. First off, the graphics. They look really good, a good improvement from the PS3 version of Mass Effect 2. Everyone looks nicer than they were in ME2. However, there are things that are noticeable to me that were kinda appeal to me as lazy work or probably just couldn't handle much more detailed textures for the console but at least, make it look decent instead a ridiculous looking sprite. There's a problem about the game running the graphics and such. The problem is that there's no HDD install and so the game disc is constantly running. It's a problem because loading the game's content such as graphics, sounds, and all that stuff just to play the game takes awhile and the PS3's blu-ray drive tries its best to keep the game running well. There's a reason why PS3 games get an HDD install. We get an HDD install from the games because so that they can load faster and run well, if not smooth. I don't know why Bioware didn't do this for Mass Effect 3 and they sure didn't do it for Mass Effect 2. It makes you wonder if they ever care about us PS3 gamers. The gameplay for Mass Effect 3 is good. The aiming is a lot better than in ME2. The way you aim around with the right stick just feels right and to me, it's precisely smooth. What I was really happy about was the quicksave button. I don't think there's any game that I've played that has such a feature and the games that does have the feature is usually the PC games. I would just press select and the game would make a quicksave. So pretty much, you would have an autosave, quicksave, and the manual saves you've made in the game. I save a lot and tend to have more than one save, just in case I messed up or something. Oh and if anyone is wondering if you can import your ME2 PS3 save file to ME3, then the answer is yes absolutely.
For multiplayer, I don't see the reason as to why it's in the game. To me, there's no point in having a multiplayer mode for a series that has been a single player since the first game. If anyone is wondering if you need the Galaxy at War rating to 100% then no, you really do not have to. Unless you miss a few, if not some missions in single player then you probably have to. Otherwise, a tip for ya, get as much war assets as you can in single player. Complete every mission and you won't have to worry about multiplayer. But then again, if you want to make sure like I did, then get Galaxy at War rating up to 100% before you finish the game and have at least one level 20 character promoted to add self as a war asset which makes a huge difference for your effective military strength. Yeah, not total, effective. Effective military strength, as far as I know, need to be over 5000. I got mine over 6000 but yeah the ending, a lot of people aren't happy about that.
So, that's where I review about the game's story. It's all good from the beginning until, before the very end of the game. I know most people are mad about the ending but put myself in a closure for the game. I know, weird but I'm not gonna waste time about how the ending really is. I thought it was okay but yeah, it should have been better. I mean, this is a sci-fi action RPG (if it can still be considered as an action RPG, whatever) trilogy that should have ended with the greatest fireworks you have ever seen in your entire life so far. But, to me, I'm left with more questions and wondering more than ever. I enjoyed every moment when I was playing the game. I've even considered the whole game except the ending itself, as the ending, if you know what I mean. Overall, I got the game, still no regrets because it's a game.

1) When I ran into Morrigan my mage character had specialized in almost all the same abilities. This did not lead to a good balance and the game quickly got about 5 times harder as I scrambled to separate their specialties in the next few levels. Since the game has no concept of ""respeccing"" (without a mod for PC and never on the console) you're pretty much kind of screwed or having to gimp the game by putting it to Easy just to get by if you run into bad party balance/planning.

2) There is no indication of what a ""main"" quest is vs. what a ""side"" quest is. It is not always obvious. Oftentimes I'd be following a storyline and it would take me to a new area where I would be locked out of all the side quests I'd started in the previous area but never got to finish. The log would reflect things like ""The outcome of the wounded mabari was never determined."" Well !@#$%&. After this happened for the 2nd time I started to get pissed off as I like to do as many side quests as possible, or at least finish the ones I started before I get unceremoniously locked out of an area. I missed out on at least 2 NPC companions due to this, also.

3) No matter how I try to position everyone in the party to maintain some semblance of control before an expected encounter (such as with Shades), the fight ends up still feeling like a total chaotic free-for-all.

4) I loved Neverwinter Nights and all the expansions. I never finished Neverwinter Nights 2 because every time I'd pick it up the control scheme would turn me completely off again. I don't know what the hell happened but I don't recall the NWN1 control scheme bothering me nearly as much. The problem in DragonAge, at least on the console version, is that if you play someone like a mage who can easily accumulate a dozen abilities, picking which ability to use in the middle of a fight is a pain in the ass if it's not one of the 3 or so ""hotbarred"" abilities. I don't understand why Bioware can't do some UI/UX testing to clean up these terrible interface decisions which mar an otherwise great game.

5) I do like being able to set up complex decision trees for party members. I don't like having to purchase new slots to allow more decisions.

6) After getting frustrated with the lack of respeccing but wanting so badly to like this game I purchased the Mac version and manually installed the respec mod as there's currently no Mac mod installer (maybe I should write one, it's not that hard, but it is technical). I'm currently going through that with a new mage character (ugh... origin story all over again) but I haven't gotten to the camp yet so no respeccing yet...

7) Having thus paid for this game *twice*, I still can only install the Mac/PC version on *one* computer at a time due to their annoying CP scheme.

8) I give up trying to bed Morrigan. I'll just watch the youtube video. I'm sure Leiliana is more giving in the sack anyway. >..<

I like the show enough that a game based on it interested me.

Good news: The story and dialogue are exactly what a Buffy fan would want from a Buffy game. The ability to play as Sid is great -- except that it only lasts one level. I liked playing as different characters, since playing as Buffy got repetative.

Bad news: The game uses backtracking to increase the amount of time you spend playing. By the zoo level, we lost our patience and found a walkthrough online. I guess we were supposed to know that we had to grab the top of an automatic fence as it lifts up to get to the other side of a room??? Yes, my girlfriend and I got a cheap thrill by 'beating' the game by cheating. By that point we were tired of the game's poor camera and ditzy fighting engine, which makes the game approach 'unplayable' at certain points. In fact, the camera is so disfunctional that it prevents you from even using the many fighting moves that the characters all have. Since the camera was always changing, so were the directions I was supposed to be pushing on the stick....

The first thing you'll notice with Heritage of War is the super-limited edition packaging that features a book of the game's art and a CD of the game's music as well.

There are graphical glitches and clipping issues aplenty, with some poorly animated character models and collision detection problems as well.  The game's story also isn't half as epic (or good) as it thinks it is, and features just about every cliche RPG story element you can think of.

Here's the goods and bads of Halo Wars

The graphics are simple, but they work.  There's really nice lighting effects, shading, dimension, etc.  It works.  It won't win awards, but it works.

The game is SOLID - no lagging, no crashing, even in HUGE conflicts with multiple units running around.  I've never had a single problem, and that's a FIRST for a console RTS.

The controls are easy.  I've never seen a shorter learning curve on a console RTS.  The options stay in the same place with every building or unit.  You quickly get to the point where you can point, click, flick-click and exit out of the menu, and have 100% confidence that what you wanted, you'll get.

Now, the bad stuff...

Halo Wars left out the most important part of an RTS game - the ability to create groups.  A lot of times you end up with critical units - units that MUST survive - for whatever reason.  But you have no way to select just that unit, or MORE IMPORTANTLY, select every unit BUT that unit.  One of my favorite ways to play RTS games is to build fleets of identical size and unit counts.  Each fleet will have everything from infantry to assault vehicles.  I then flank my enemy from multiple directions with these fleets, stretching their resources thin until my three fleets effectively reach ""the middle,"" and wipe out the bad guys.

This strategy simply isn't possible with Halo Wars.  You can do it once - the initial attack.  You'll have to group your fleets in common areas, select the area and issue the command.  Once the groups have begun to spread or mingle with each other, you can't separate them anymore.  How in the world you can build an RTS without the grouping feature is beyond me.

The units are pretty weak - they die easily.  The unit counts are low - too low to support defense strategies with any more than 2 or 3 bases.  The bases themselves are a total dissapointment.  As another reviewer commented, they're ""cookie cutter"" bases.  Each base consists of a central ""hub"" with anywhere from 3 to 7 ""pods"" around it, and you can selet what you want in each pod.  There's no feeling of ""home"" with any base - no pride in your design - and that kills it.

Halo Wars is a flawless interface with a sub-par RTS game.  It's not bad, but it certainly isn't great.",One GLARING omission...,1237334400,4,,

As far as a collector's edition goes, this was a really good one. Not only do you get a very nice statue, and a great looking package, you also get some very decent stuff in the game. On top of that you get an authenticator, which in my opinion should be standard for CEs. This package really did have it all, but sadly the game was nowhere near the quality of this package.

The crazy thing is, I pre-ordered mine at Gamestop. Then, after reading about all the people who cancelled their pre-orders at Amazon, I quickly came here and snagged a second one. At the time I was thinking that was a wise financial decision, but now, considering you can still buy these, and the prices for them are falling... well... maybe it was not such a good decision after all. I am just glad I did not buy more.

Obviously I am hoping the game does well, and the demand for these rise... or that the statue somehow becomes coveted, but I am certainly not holding my breath.

Game-wise there are some key features missing, and little to no innovation to make up for it. Beyond the fact that it is Star Wars, as an MMO it really does not have it's own identity, yet the mashings and sprinklings of those before it.

377669,3.0,True,"02 10, 2017",A1HVSLIS25RNY6,B00NASF4PA,Amazon Customer,"After playing this game for over a month, playing through the main story once, and completing various modes such as ""Arcade"" and ""Survival"" numerous times, I give this game a 3/5.

Graphics are good. The look of the characters is so much better in this one compared to previous games. Not only are the images crisper, but the actual design is better. Characters look less like Japanese cartoons and a bit more like real people, though they do still have slightly cartoonish faces, especially in the eyes. Also the character models are a bit lacking in diversity and true-to-life representation. By that I mean Kasumi is a character from Japan yet has a similar face to Marie Rose, who is from Sweden. This is no issue to me, but I think some people might prefer that characters look more like them or more like how they would perceive someone from that part of the world.

The Costumes are nice. Every character has at least 3 costumes, while some have close to 10. Typically the women characters have more costumes, so that might be a downer for some. All the men have a main costume then a variant, while women usually have a few stylish outfits and then a selection of 1-3 bikinis.

The actual fighting for this game is decent, though it can be annoying when your attacks keep getting blocked, and when an opponent goes on a long combo attack it feels like there is nothing you can do.

I would have liked for there to have been more to do. Pretty much all this game features is fighting, though there is a photograph mode where you can take pictures but I don't use that and frankly I think it would be weird if I was in the living room photographing digital women in bikinis.

To address the people that say this game is sexist, I would have to disagree. I've heard some people say that the women should have smaller breasts and more clothes, but I disagree. I think they should simply add more variety of clothing for males. If DOA6 adds a bunch of male swimsuits and male characters with more significant bulge, as a male I don't find that sexist, that just is what it is. There are a few male characters that have black shorts, like what an MMA fighter would wear, though you'll notice that there is almost no bulge at all, which I think is a bit silly. Also, while the females are all model-like, the same could be said of the men. They are buff, with toned abs, and everyone has a flawless, model-ready face. Even Bayman, a Russian soldier, has a scar on his face, yet he is still shown as very handsome and what not. Personally, I find nothing wrong with the fact that the designers wanted to make most of the characters attractive. I just suggest that the next game have more costumes for the men. (For the record I am a straight male if you were wondering.)

Next, there are a few ""Virtua Fighter"" characters in this game. I HATE those characters. Their moves don't match the style of DOA, and their voice acting is TERRIBLE. I am not even exaggerating! The voice acting for the Virtua Fighter characters is really really bad, like the quality sounds like it was recorded with a really cheap microphone, every time they speak it sounds like an arcade game from the 90s, it is embarrassing that it made it into the game. So the game would really be better if those lame characters were not brought into this.

A few characters I don't like: Alpha 152, because she is literally just a copy of Kasumi but blue and has no clothes. And they added yet another Kasumi clone called Number-4 or something like that, and she is just Kasumi with a hood on. Lastly, there is Zack, he is the one black character in the game and he is depicted as not having a lot of control over himself (like, they make him kind of pervy) and he has green hair and he is literally just some weird version of Dennis Rodman (a basketball player) and I really just would have preferred they used someone else as inspiration such as Blade (Wesley Snipes) or even Will Smith or something.

Overall, this game is solid, but doesn't do anything really special. After seeing Dragonball Xenoverse 2 and all it does, I hope DOA6 chooses to expand their world and stories and characters. I do like that this game is 4 players, as that is always a bonus, though I don't really like fighting against certain people I game with because if you are better than them at the game then sometimes it is awkward and some people get upset. Anyway, that is my opinion on the game and if you liked any of the other DOAs this is a game for you.","Solid, But Not Inspired",1486684800,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The Bad: No counter attack button?, plastic graphics, uninspired story, God of War rip off?, no hidden sex mini-game, long load times

If no one knows much about Conan there are a few things you should know. He is NOT a comic super hero (he does have comics, but that's not his origin) and second Arnold Schwarzenegger is plays the best Conan ever. The story is not exactly great, but it evolves around the Conan mythology where he seeks the four pieces of armor to defeat Graven who has put the Black Death upon the world. The game's story is nothing special or interesting, and the only thing that keeps you hooked is acquiring new abilities, and seeing the cool levels.

The main focus of the game is the combat which is pretty satisfying and fun. You have heavy and light attacks, a grab, you can throw weapons, and use magic. You have different fighting styles by picking up different weapons such as double handed weapons, dual wield, sword and shield, or single sword. Each of these has it's own set of attacks you can acquire by upgrading. There are tons of attacks and you may not even acquire all of them by the end of the game. The combat, ironically, is also the most flawed part of the game because there is no counter attack button, enemies will wail on you and kill you without have some sort of shock wave type attack to knock them away, plus the heavy enemies can be really cheap. You try to attack them and they'll block but there is no block breaker attacks that are effective. You can grab small enemies and do as you wish with them such as take their weapon and slice them in half, take their shield etc.

The magic system is only used when you're in dire need of help. You have four attacks over the course of the game yet they seem to use too much energy so you're left dry after a few attacks. You can increase your health and magic by finding three circles on the ground and stabbing them. These can sometimes be hard to find so hopefully you have enough health to survive through the course of the game. While the combat is fun it still has it's frustrations like I pointed out, but it's nothing you can't handle.

Now that we have the core of the game put aside let's talk about visuals. The game has great graphics yet they look like plastic. The characters have low-res textures and everything just looks like it's made of plastic. The game has pre-set camera angles like in God of War so you don't have to worry about fighting the camera. The game has lots and lots of buckets of blood and guts and lots of...mammaries. Yes there are nude women in the game and these come in the form of helpless maidens. Conan must find them chained up in places and free them. They yell things like ""Crush me with your love!"", and ""I didn't my savior would be so...strong."", and ""My clothes! Where are my clothes?"". While this may be corny it's still hot and you gotta love it.

Speaking of God of War the game has a lot of similarities to that game such as a giant dragon fight inside a building (think of the first boss fight in Chains of Olympus (PSP), a giant squid on a boat (think of the Hydra in God of War (PS2), the fixed sweeping camera angles, lots of blood and guts, nude women, a buff overaggressive hero, a sexy heroine he has to save, wow the list just goes on and on. I think a certain developer tried making a God of War clone and it's written all over Conan's Neanderthalian face!

No matter though the game is pretty fun and you'll appreciate these similarities. The achievements are easy to unlock and there is incentive to play through again thanks to those, but the game is extremely short with a playtime of 6-8 hours depending on how slow or fast you are. I highly recommend Conan if you can look past the many bugs (collision detection issues, invisible walls), combat flaws (no counter attack, wailing enemies), and nude women (well...I'm sure you can handle that :-) .

First, there is no ""prone"" position for your guy. This is really frustrating to anyone used to playing BF2 Multiplayer. You can only crouch, or stand up.

Second, BF2 holds 64 players, BFBadCompany holds 24.

Third, enemies take too many bullets to go down. It's something I didn't like about BF2, and its worse in this game.

Fourth, no clear orders are sent to squads, and no UAV.

77210,3.0,False,"12 12, 2006",A2X8KN82L07RSK,B000CBVC0Y,C. Johnson,"I originally got DA for the regular XBOX, and played a few levels.  I thought it was pretty good, but not as good as past Splinter Cells.  When I finally got a 360 I decided to trade my XBOX version of DA for the 360 version.  This turned out to be a mistake, and shortly after playing the 360 version of the game, I wanted my XBOX on back.

First off the levels in the 360 version are different than the regular XBOX version.  This is OK in itself, but to me the levels are just so boring an do not make much sense.  To me it seems that the level were just thrown together with no thought on how things would play out when someone actually played the level.  A good example is the first ""real"" level at the JBA headquarters.  You had to do a couple of things for the NSA, and to do this you had to find time to go to a restricted area to plant some bugs.  Your main task was for the JBA to go through a pretty simple obstacle course and open a safe at the end, all of which takes 4 minutes.  However you are given 15 minutes to complete the task.  How convienient, plenty of time to plant bugs.  And what makes this worse, even after you finished your tasks for the JBA and NSA you will more than likely have 3 or 4 minute left, and then you HAVE to wait those 3 or 4 minutes IN REAL time for the guy to come check on you.  How lame can you get? Its a complete waste of time.  I blew it off, because it was one of the first levels, but the next levels I played were just as boring.

Another thing that I found missing was the many of the cool things you could do or had access to in past Splinter Cell games is not in DA for the 360.  Even the Xbox version has these things, but the 360 version does not.  Example, you cannot remote hack, you don't have the visibility and sound meters on your opsat, the enemy tracker in your 3D map does not show enemy positions in real time, its only a snapshot; so if the enemy is walking, you won't see it on your map.  the regular XBOX version of th game has this, why not the 360 version?  I don't know if you can do the split jump or not, but I never had an opportunity to try it.  You can unlock different gadgets by completing tasks without getting detected by the enemy, but why not have them in the game to begin with?  It just makes the game more frustrating.  One thing I hate about video games, is when they make you unlock stuff that should already be in the game.

One of the only good things about this game was the graphics and sound.  But even the sound seemed to mess up during the gameplay.  Without warning the sound of enemy talk and weapons firing would go out and you couldn't hear anything except of the enviroment itself and sometimes the background music. In addition to this, my game has frozen a few times without warning, forcing me to start over.  Another strike.

The game itself played OK, the controls were pretty responsive for the most part but even that messed up.  When the sound started going out, your controls seemed to be affected as well, and there was a slight delay when firing your weapon.

One final thing about the gameplay that was pretty corny in my opinion, is that you have this stupid light on your suit that shows green when noone sees you, but as soon as an enemy sees you it turns red.  Why is this nesccesary?  This was not in previous splinter cell games, and I think a good reason for that is that it's not needed and it looks stupid.  It's just more proof that this game was just thrown together without any real thought into actual gameplay.

I thought I would never give a Splinter Cell game a bad review, but the XBOX 360 version of this game gave me no choice.  I finally had enough, so I returned the game back to the store for a full refund. (Thank goodness I bought it used).  I had to rebuy my traded game back for the lower used price, but that was OK with me.  So instead of getting the full cost for DA for the 360 back, I only netted 20 bucks.  Its still OK with me though, because I wasn't at all happy with the 360 version.  I am back to the regular XBOX version of the game, and I couldn't be happier.

If you have or thinking about getting Double Agent for the regular XBOX, keep it!  To me the 360 version is a huge dissapointment and I encourage others to stick with the more polished regular XBOX version.

First off, it's a great looking game but then that's what you come to expect with the next-gen PS console. The other PS4 game I got (Tomb Raider) definitely didn't disappoint in that department either. The controls are easy enough to get used to, even though they are different than the previous two. The storyline is a completely new one, with a few nods to the others but it stands on its own.

Now, here's where I thought it was lackluster and and I'm wondering where all these 5 star ""amazing"" ""stellar"" and ""awesome"" reviews are coming from. How in the heck do you keep track of your health? The only thing you know is when you are close to dead or are are dead. It was much easier to recover or gain health before, just find a power line and voila! Now, you have to find a shard or some smoke to drain, which can be difficult in the midst of a fight. Or, find some cover, which if you're being surrounded by armed guards, particularly the ones with powers, can also be difficult. You don't seem to pose a real threat to the armed forces until your powers are highly upgraded, which will take quite awhile. You die way too easily. A few turret hits or a few armed guards surrounding you with gunfire is all it takes. Then when you die, you end up at the closest fast travel destination but if you already cleared that district, what's the point of being there? You have to then high tail it back to the district you're working on.

Lastly, the game is very repetitive. Clear the main command center in a district, complete all the side missions, collect all the shards, do the showdown, onto the next district, then  wash, rinse, repeat. It gets really boring after awhile.

I played Bloodborne and even though it was brutal in it's own way as well, it was fair...mostly. And the environment and incredibly awesome combat made it a game that even though was a love/hate relationship at times I will always still cherish playing (I have two BB posters - Lol). Enter SoTFS. Only reasons I played this before trying DS3 was because it was remastered for PS4 and I wanted to get an idea of what DS games were like before BB. My impression? First, even remastered it doesn't look anywhere near as good as BB (or vids I've seen of DS3 for that matter), and second, the early to mid-game bosses are relatively easy compared to BB, I breezed through the first 25 or so bosses pretty quickly, but the levels themselves are completely another story. They are incredibly difficult, to the point of being ridiculously unfair. I've beaten 37 bosses out of 41 total and I have lost WAY more souls than I ever did in BB. Of course, at this point the bosses have dramatically risen in difficulty and I'm currently having to farm souls to level up cause I'm stuck on three of them at the same time. Luckily, the SoTFS made some changes and I found an area that is relatively easy to grind, but the game just seems particularly unfair to the player and I've never played a game that puts so many obstacles in your way to succeeding. It just seems that they were trying too hard to make up for all of the criticisms of the original DS2 and went overboard. Near the end of the game there are a few cool/unique/challenging bosses but most of them (so far) are mostly forgettable.

I'm a moderate gamer; the new controls are generally more complicated than I'm willing to commit to. He is a hard core gamer. Some games are easier to watch than others, and some are easier to play. This review is not for the hard core gamer. This review if for the girlfriend (or boyfriend, who am I to judge?) that sits on the couch and watches.

From the start, this game is somewhat frustrating. The female lead, Aya, comes off as bi-polar and a bit crazy. The next set of characters to join your party are child twins, Rico and Rucha. I don't think it would be possible for the two of them to not be annoying. Aya gets a little less psycho as the game goes on, and the characters improve drastically from team you start off with, even though there is plenty of annoying and crazy to come. But, it's not the annoying characters that make this game so frustrating.

You would swear that save points are expensive to make, at least if you go by this game's total lack of them. It's one thing to have to fight a boss more than once, but it's a whole other level of annoying when you have to replay the 20 minutes to get that boss every time you die. Oh, and don't get me started on that stupid magic fog swamp. I get it, it's a puzzle and it's supposed to be hard, but it shouldn't be so hard that it makes you want to quit the game. These small hour long detours in frustration are nothing compared to the agony of the final battle. I don't think I'm giving away too much if I say you have to fight about half a dozen moderately difficult enemies before you hit a save point. After several, and I mean several, attempts of being thwarted at various rooms, we did something we both loathe. We left the castle and fought random enemies until we leveled up. That was three or four hours of not very much fun. Alas, it did work, and we were able to finish the game.

We took longer than some people did to finish this game, it timed in at about 35 hours, but because of the several failed attempts, I'm sure we played it for over 60. The game was a great effort, and at times the story intense enough for me to not want to turn off the game, but overall there was something lacking. I know there were several side quests we completely missed, but I don't think that is the reason I didn't feel satisfied when it was done.

She immediately wanted to play it that Christmas Day and as we set into playing, at first she was in awe that it in was Radiator Springs.  She had a good laugh at all the tractors and other characters from the movie(s).  There was a lot of pointing at the screen in our first sessions.  When Finn McMissile was introduced, her glee couldn't be contained.

For the first day or so of playing, she was happy enough that it was simply Cars.  But I noted that after those initial gaming periods, she began requesting older playsets, like The Incredibles.  I wondered what was wrong.

She explained and I will translate the 6 year old's explanation: being that you control cars, there is a lot racing to be done.  Whether an actual side by side race, or one where you chase down an errant vehicle, and she does not understand racing.  She is not very good at racing and loses every race that the game throws at her.  Her frustration begins to build until reaches the point where she'd rather play another playset or Toy Box mode.

As the adult I have raced with her and tried to let her win, but unfortunately, the opponents (like Chick Hicks) aren't so nice.  Every race comes off as a do-or-die, must-win situation and each racer is very competitive and will use the sideways bash move to get you out of the way.  I have tried to beat the race and even I found myself growing frustrated at the opponents.  I wish there was a way to ""dial down"" the race aggressiveness.

I think she is a little young for this title, which surprised me based on the characters and theme set.  She is enjoying the time spent around Radiator Springs, but each new 'quest' brings on a new race and she wants no more of that.",Surprised at frustration levels (6 years),1390521600,5,{'Style:': ' Cars Play Set'},

The gameplay concept, the visual style, the soundtrack, even the backstory are all conceived and executed with such a unique flavor that, when presented as a whole, it's difficult not to be drawn in by all the weird little idiosyncrasies. It's not a complex game, nor is it especially challenging, or long.

Using the analog sticks exclusively, you'll roll the katamari around with tanklike controls. Pushing both sticks up moves the katamari forward, pushing both sticks down moves it backward, and pushing one stick up and one stick down will cause it to turn. There are a few other tricks, such as moving both sticks up and down really fast to gain a quick boost, or pushing in on both sticks to hop on the other side of the katamari and quickly change directions--but this is basically all you'll need to know in order to control it. However, controlling it well is a more nuanced thing. The shapes of the things you collect will affect the overall shape of your katamari, thus affecting how it actually rolls.

The only difference is they added on motion controls, which by all accounts are abysmal. I never even bothered to try using the new Wii controls, and opted instead for the classic controller. Wii remote motion controls for a fighting game is just a terrible idea and won't work for anything other than Wii Sports Boxing. I did the same thing with Super Smash Bros. Brawl and never used the motion controls for that one either.

MK: Armageddon is basically the same as previous 3D MK titles, such as Deception. You have Konquest mode which is sort of a story based adventure mode you can play through. I found this to be really boring and poorly done. You have to play through it if you want to unlock everything, but from what I recall there's  not a whole lot that actually requires you to play through this mode. Certain things require you to unlock them in Konquest mode, but the others just cost coins. You can earn coins in Konquest mode to purchase unlockables, but you can also earn these from playing the arcade mode as well. Personally, I'd probably rather grind arcade mode for the coins rather than finish Konquest mode. The unlockables include a variety of things such as new stages, alternate costumes, artwork, etc. There's quite a bit of stuff to be had.

Probably the biggest attraction to MK Armageddon is the huge amount of characters. They really do have a ton and that alone makes it worthwhile. The combat feels pretty much like all the other 3D MK games, so if you enjoyed Deadly Alliance and Deception, you'll enjoy Armageddon. I don't like how they handled the fatalities at all in this game though. This time around they decided to make it a ""create a fatality"", which basically means you can choose how you want to dismember someone depending on what button combination you press. So you could punch off their head, or do a number of other things. While this might sound cool, this is the only sort of fatalities they have in the game period. It's not an additional fatality type like the Brutalities and other things from previous MK's. So you'll have no specialized fatalities at all. No Reptile shooting out his tongue and swallowing their head. No Scorpion taking off his mask and torching them. So that's a huge negative in my book. They also have a create a fighter mode and a kart racing game. I haven't spent time with either one, but from what I understand the kart racing is actually entertaining.

Overall, MK Armageddon isn't a terrible game, but it's not going to amaze or wow you. The sheer number of fighters is the main attraction. Just about every character in the MK series is here. If you played it on PS2 or Xbox you're going to be getting the exact same game here, as it's a direct port. No enhanced graphics or anything else. If you're interested in getting it for the Wii controls added on, don't bother with that. It's a tacked on addition that's just going to frustrate you and make you hook up your classic controller. If you only have a Wii, your fighting game options are limited, so this might be worthwhile to pick up for a dirt cheap price, especially if you're a big MK fan. You'd probably get more value out of Tatsunoko vs. Capcom or Guilty Gear on your Wii if you're looking for a fighter though. If you have a 360 or PS3 I'd say just wait for the new Mortal Kombat game coming out. That one looks amazingly awesome and you'll probably never touch this game again once it's out. You could also just get the Midway arcade compilations they made for PS2 and Xbox to get your MK fix if you didn't already get UMK3 and MK2 on Live and PSN. I think Midway pulled their catalog from Live and PSN, so if you didn't already get those you're out of luck there.

Bottom line: Not so great, but could do a lot worse. Only worth it if you buy it for dirt cheap. It's $15 right now on amazon so you might want to check a local used game store first to see if you can get it cheaper perhaps, but $15 isn't too bad a price I guess. If you didn't like Deadly Alliance or the previous 3D MK games, you're not going to like this one either.",Forget the Wii controls,1290988800,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

So, I put it in, booted it up and decided to play a couple laps to test it out. Almost immediately a single fatal problem crops up: the 'camera.' It seems to like to randomly change camera direction / perspective in the middle of gameplay, making it nearly impossible to know which way you're supposed to push the control stick. Yeah, that's a problem... Sometimes after you do a trick or wipe out or go the wrong way, the camera is in front of you facing backwards so you can't see ahead of you to have any clue where you're going or which way to steer.

So far, I can't seem to find a way to change the camera angle manually or tell it to stop changing camera angle on its own accord.

The large majority of games I play are RPGs and/or are originally for the SNES (Mario-type games). So I'm gearing my review to people with interests in that area.

Going into this game I wasn't expecting much and I was pleasantly surprised. It was actually pretty fun. The main problem I had with it was the handwriting. I have nice handwriting, but when in a rush it can get very messy. It's not a big deal because the more you play the more you adjust to what is recognized as what.
My other issue is the lack of ""playability"". This is speaking from a gamer point of view. You can play each of the training games once a day and that's it. I understand the reason for this, but it's disheartening to not be able to play the games I like again. (You can, but it's the exact same one you played before.)

I give this game 3 stars because it's not something I would recommend to my friends nor would I would purchase for myself AFTER having played it (if I didn't already own it).
HOWEVER, if you love puzzles, this might be the perfect game for you. I do play it everyday and when they say ""train your brain in minutes a day"" tey weren't kidding. The longest I stayed on the game (just in training mode and brain age mode) was 15 min. It has Sudoku as well as a secret mini-game( DS version of tetris) which can be played over and over again and are intended to be more on the fun side of brain exercising. (The others CAN be fun, but they are more intended to work your brain.)

All-in-all it's not a bad game, but is (obviously) more for people who are into puzzles. If you like puzzles, but like to be able to play something again and again, this might not be the best game for you. (Unless, of course, you love Sudoku!)",Not Bad...,1190160000,2,,

1. It's huge.  Granted, to include the extra key pad it would need to be bigger, but it really didn't need to be that big.

I myself have average female hands and while I was also able to use it decently, it was way too big to be comfortable.

The problem is that this isn't really a sequal, as the original premise of a dinosaur hunter has been scrapped.  Too bad too because that's what made the game stand out from all the other shoot-em-ups.  But at least they've given the game an excellent design that has no problems standing alongside others in this genre.  Graphics are crisp and clean but kept dark to heighten the scare factor.  In other words, instead of fog like in the first Turok, things are kept in shadow here.  I've noticed some stuttering in the cut scens, but never durring the game itself.  By the way, the cut scenes are done very very well, so much so that the characters lips seem to be in sync with the dialogue!
Note that there is definitely less blood and gore in this game than Turok 2.  I'm not complaining tough.  I don't see the need for so much gore.  But don't get me wrong, the M rating is deserved as you can decapitate enemies and blood does fly when you shoot an enemy.  Also the overall feel of the game is very dark/creepy.  This a good game to play on a dark night to get really spooked.  A great feature is that you have a choice of playing as one of two characters at the beginning which that adds a bit of replay value to the title.  You'll be able to use different weapons and access different areas depending on which character you choose.
One real problem I have with the game is that the on-screen gun site is so small and darkly colored that I have a really hard time seeing where it is in the heat of battle.  Using the auto target system doesn't seem to do much at all as even when there is only one enemy coming towards me the site won't target it.  What's up with that?  This little flaw makes the game much harder than it should be and causes A LOT of frustration.  Thankfully there are many places to save game progress.
So my overall feeling is that this is a very solid game but one that lacks any real orginality or invention.  I really miss the feeling and story of the original Turok and would much rather see future sequals follow in it's footsteps.  Hunting dionsaurs is too fun an idea to pass on so quickly.

The dungeons were simplistic but fun, the bosses were imaginative, and frankly quite amazing given they were on the DS. Unfortunately the makers put in a temple you must return to after EVERY FREAKING dungeon. The temple is soooooo boring, and repetitive. That would be bad, but not only is it boring and repetitive, they've filled it with the worst possible game play mechanics possible. So every time you finish one of the dungeons, instead of a feeling of elation, accomplishment and excitement of going on to the next quest, you're filled with a feeling of dread knowing that you have to go back and starting from the VERY BEGINNING go through the same tedious temple you've been through a thousand times before. They say half-way through the game you can start halfway through the temple. No. You can start halfway through the temple if AND ONLY IF you get to this save point with enough time left to make it worth while to continue, which if you're playing it for the first time you don't realize and start at the beginning. Like I said this wouldn't be so bad if the temple weren't so devoid of any fun what so ever. Here's a list of why it's so bad:

(1) Time limit. You're constantly watching the clock. If you get to close to the end and run out of time, you have to start over again
(2) Unbeatable guards you can't kill, if they catch you, you not only go back to the start, but you loose 30 seconds
(3) Annoying eyeballs you need to shoot, and while the controls are good, more often than not when you have to react quickly you'll be hitting the walls more than the enemies
(4) Floors that attract enemies, so not only do you have a time limit and all the crap I mentioned above, at certain points you have to move so slowly you're basically crawling
(5) IT TAKES FOR EVER TO GET THROUGH THESE HORRIBLE DUNGEONS - They're not fun, just tedious you want them over fast. It's seriously feels like they're punishing you.

DOES ANY OF THAT SOUND FUN!? (If it does man, then you just knock yourself right out with this bad boy)

This dungeon was so awful I put the game down.

4695,3.0,False,"07 31, 2003",A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00001LCDP,Rottenberg&#039;s rotten book review,"This is the original CFS.  Though CFS3 is out by now, those owning older computers, even those that can run CFS2, should consider CFS1 as an alternative.  CFS1 is set in Europe - allowing you to fly fighter missions using the tried and true Microsoft Flight Simulator engine (formerly the BAO flight sim engine).  Surprisingly, this is a pretty effective sim for one that many could easily boil down to ""Flight simulator with guns"".  Unfortunately, despite the challenges of adapting skills amassed flying combat flight sims with less realistic flight modeling, CFS1 never really becomes more than ""Flight simulator with guns"".
In CFS1, you can fly on-line, single missions, or campaigns.  Using the MSFS engine, it is as adaptable as any edition of ""Microsoft Flight Simulator"" in terms of add-on aircraft, scenery or missions.  (Be aware, that while there's no shortage of modern military aircraft available for sale or for download, the inherenent design of this game is towards pre-modern aircraft.  Neither the sophisticated systems nor guided weapons are available).  There are actually 2 campaigns - the Battle of Britain (summer of 1940) in which you intercept (or escort) waves of the Luftwaffe's medium level bombers or dive bombers against industrial and defense targets in England or Channel shipping and the daylight bombing campaign against Europe starting around 1943.  CFS1 is entirely a fighter-driven game - barring user customization, you can't fly big bombers.  On the flip side, fighters can be armed with rockets or bombs.  While you can fly for the Luftwaffe in either campaign, your choice on the allied side is limited.  I can understand being stuck with the RAF for the Battle of Britain (the attack on Pearl, and America's entry into the war was still over a year away), but didn't the RAF fly at all in 1943-45?  The campaigns are short and scripted: you fly the same mission until you get it right.  To be honest, the mission goals aren't demanding (I'm more likely to get snagged by crashing into a wingman or getting too close to an enemy), and the repetitive aspect of pre-scripted missions would be little improved by a dynamic campaign, since most missions would be the same anyway (how much of a Mustang pilot's time wasn't spent escorting waves of B-17's?).  One tip for escorting the bombers - you may have caught Edmund O'Brien as a P-47 driver in ""Fighter Squadron"" (1948) who chafes under rules that require his pilots to stick with the bombers and not chase enemy planes to the deck.  Just remember, the time you've spent after you break formation to chase an Me-109 away, will easily be exceeded by how long it will take you to rejoin, especially if you went for the deck and must now claw back up to your formation's flight level.  This is especially critical since other Me-109s will exploit your absence to cut into your formations.  Stick with the bombers!
I can't say how realistic flight modeling was - I'd expected worse remembering how pitiful I was on the WWI mission included on the original BAO Flight Sim (c. 1982).  Visually, the planes are lovely, though this is an old game, and it won't bowl you over.  Damage modeling is suspect - CFS1 is stuck in an era of sims in which your plane will have a fixed response to damage; this is despite a more effective damage model in ""Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe"" (1990) in which a given hit from an enemy will lead to progressive deterioration in your plane's condition.  Ground targets and ships are completely implausible - one hit from your rockets and destroyers, u-boats and merchantmen (which remain parked like sitting ducks) disappear in fireballs ala ""Battlestar Galactica"", which hints that this project was rushed to shelves.  (The other hint is the appearance of Me-262 jets - they only appear in one mission, and as ground targets.  How did that happen?)
So, what's really wrong?  A weak mission generator and the same aircraft we've seen in over ten years in flight sims.  MS probably guessed that it wasn't worth their time to do more than add guns and damage models to the FS engine - people would just download the missions, flight panels, scenery or aircraft files they wanted anyway.  Sure the game has the big planes of that theater of the war - but then did CFS1 have to wartime Europe?  With its flight engine, CFS1 would have been the perfect vehicle for a Korean war sim - an idea that MS inexplicably ignored for this and the next 2 additions.  WWII Europe simply has been simmed to death.  Terrain is incredibly flat and, especially down low, doesn't even look like terrain.  It's almost at the point where, unless you go on the `net for add-on files, there really isn't anything to simulate here.  In short, MS was hot to create a military flight sim that would adapt to any user's preference, they forgot to give it features that people would prefer to keep.  I couldn't get decent performance on my P200mmx/Voodoo2 PC.  Obviously, hardware wasn't an issue when I moved up to a P4 (no Windows XP compatibility issues here).
On a final note, CFS1's disappointments are not completely covered by CFS2.  I own both games since I wanted a Pacific war sim.  Though CFS2 is obviously an improvement, CFS1 holds up pretty well - CFS1 owners can download or buy add-on files to capture the Pacific experience.  In short, if you've got CFS1, don't feel like you've got to spend $$ for CFS2 or to upgrade your machine.","competent, light fun, but not spectacular",1059609600,2,,

With games like Mario Kart 7 and Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing, they have worked very nicely, not just in great games, but fun and challenging multiplayer racing and action. But for other game franchises they haven't actually been a full hit and miss. Hot Wheels has actually been a fun racing theme for kids with toy cars for years. But over the years, it has been very difficult to see a kids racing theme, really have the nail on the head hit well for gamers of all ages. Well, after all this time, they have tried to take that need for speed to the test again for the Nintendo 3DS. But actually this take has almost came to a full head crash that proved to be more of a misled take.

Hot Wheels: World's Best Driver for the Nintendo 3DS actually might be a challenge in name, but actually in gameplay it really is more of a miss. The game pits you in your choice of one of four teams ranging from flat out speed to testing your drift and control, to full out power in trucks. Graphically the game is a good fit to match up with other racing titles, with a good sense of detail in the terrain from traditional raceways, to tests of trying to do tricks on a half pipe style challenge with a full-fledged speed demon, to trying to make impacted crashes on the course. Sadly though, the controls here are a bit loose i the game, and they can make you easily lose your striking stance on several challenges, from trying to get the high score in a drift challenge. There is no multiplayer challenge so you cannot play against others unlike Mario Kart 7, which works well. It is a game that test the physics of the driver, but it actually isn't a full game buy.

Overall, after a little time, I really found Hot Wheels: World's Best Driver to honestly be one of the worst games on the Nintendo 3DS, especially is you want to steer your way to the finish line. It is a good challenge at first, but honestly during the tougher challenges you'll definitely think why your wasted your time on this game. If there were better controls, I would have a better time with this.

For The PC:
Let me start by giving my PC stats so we're clear I don't have a sluggish machine; 12gb ram, Hexacore i7 980 @4.2GHz, 2x GTX680 in SLI graphics and Win8.1 x64 OS and an IOGEAR Bluetooth 4.0 USB Micro Adapter. Pairing is straightforward and reliable. Actually playing games is another story.

For testing I've tried both Sleeping Dogs and Darksiders II. In general I found button response to either be a bit laggy at best and non-responsive to button/trigger pushes altogether at worst. When I play these games with the xbox pc adapter and xbox360 controller everything is fine and I'm thinking about the game and not when the heck will my button presses will register (if at all) with the SteelSeries Stratus XL. Not a good experience at all.

For Android:
I have the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 for my Android phone. Compared to the Power-A Moga Pro Power controller I found the SteelSeries to be very good. I actually even like the general feel and weight better than the Moga. But the Moga has a phone holder built-in which makes the phone and controller a single unit (which I like a lot), or if you don't like playing with the phone attached, it also come with a phone stand so you can still prop the phone up while playing. The SteelSeries doesn't come with either. Furthermore the Power-A Moga has a built-in rechargeable battery that charges via USB and will also charge your phone while playing, the SteelSeries requires 2xAA batteries.

The story is based on the graphic novel series (though I'm not familiar with them) and it's unique in that you're a mob guy that is suddenly possessed by demonic powers but it can also be incredibly predictable at times.  You meet certain characters and can immediately guess their fate.  The graphics are decent, most notably the backgrounds but often characters speak without their mouths moving, including the main character.  Mob ventriloquists, I guess.  The voice acting is also okay for the most part though unless they are pivotal to the plot, many characters just repeat generic comments.  There are also a few really goofy comments made periodically and often the main character is a bit over the top though again, maybe that is true to the comics.  There is also a good bit of backtracking as you progress through the game, which tends to get old.

The Darkness powers are the saving grace of the game, though some are far more useful than others.  I wish the developers had explored the powers a bit more because using them is really what makes the game fun.  The voice work for the Darkness and summoned creatures are quite good and the comments can be quite amusing.  I'm not sure why there are so many complaints about the controls, they seemed very basic and easy to pick up.

It came on the heels of one of the best in the series, ""Super CV 4"", and was ported from Japan from a much superior version of the same game.

Unfortunately the game fails as a follow-up to SCV4 as well as a weak version of the japanese title. It suffers many setbacks from the game that came directly before it- whip control is now much more basic, and the levels are a lot more basic, washed out, and awkward- the main character doesn't move the way we'd expect and the character sprites are just different.

Some of the great system-showcasing effects from CV4 were left behind as well. Scaling, rotation, and other fancy effects aren't really displayed here. Instead it's a pretty straightforward side-scrolling actioner without many frills.

All this would be fine if the gameplay was good, but that too is just average. As mentioned, gameplay just doesn't have the same Castlevania ""feel"" as far as gravity, speed, and so on. And while the graphics are pretty, it just isn't as fleshed out and impressive as most other Castlevania offerings. The music itself is also only fair- while there's a familiar tune here and there, and it is done well, it just isn't a new palate of instant soundtrack classics. Add to this the fact that the game gets somewhat difficult and cheap in later levels, and it amounts to a pretty shallow experience.

Compared to other Castlevanias (especially the japanese game this was based on), it fails to live up. Castlevania has always been a choice franchise, and this is one of its weakest offerings. As a standard action game, it's not bad- the game definitely doesn't just flat-out suck. But be warned, it's a very washed out experience if you're looking for the next great Castlevania. Pay the high price only if you're a collector, because the game itself is average at best.","Doesn't feel like Castlevania. Decent game, but doesn't live up.",1125878400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

121168,3.0,True,"01 20, 2010",A3J2N3MC99CLB3,B000X1PE16,ShoppingGeek,"DS has two major flaws. The first is the meteor shooting mission. It comes about 1/3rd of the way through the game, and there are probably people who never get past it. (Some PC players download the completed mission save file from the Web so they can move on, but Xboxers don't have that option.) I almost quit. I had tried it 50 times over several days (using all the tips found online), then finally after 5 tries one day, I made it, though I did not feel that I did anything different from how I played it the other times.

After I finished the game, I restarted from scratch. This time I failed 20 times in one day. Came back the next day and got it on the first try. Again, I didn't feel like I played any different when I made it. I think it depends on a huge luck factor. I noticed that when I won, I got only 1 of the big meteors and almost none of the fast ones. What's the point when what it takes to win is not skill but just the whim of the game?

I find that replaying a mission even 5 times quickly becomes not-fun, and this is about as boring and as un-fun as any mission can get (shooting at incoming meteors). Failing 50 times, or even 20 times, or even 10 times, is just ricidulous when winning is mainly luck.

The other flaw is that the game just isn't very long. When a game developer produces a game, they can make it last a long time by putting in lots of missions and places to explore, like Fallout 3 does, or they can avoid doing all that extra work by just making it so that you have to replay each mission at least several times. In contrast, you can play Bioshock on Hard all the way through without ever dying and the game lasts a lot longer than this one.

A relatively minor flaw is that you cannot skip long narrative portions of the game, which is really boring after the first playthrough, especially if you have to replay a scene multiple times. This is yet another ""cheat"" used to make games last longer.

Those flaws aside, the game is a lot of fun to play and is very scary. When you die, you usually start over right before the scene in which you died, and with the same health and ammo you had at the start, which is much better than, say, Grand Theft Auto 4.

There is a good variety of foes which attack in different ways and which require different types of weapons to defeat efficiently, and the different weapons are fun to use and upgrade, though it is not possible to fully upgrade more than 1 or 2 weapons on the first playthrough, even if you never upgrade your suit or stasis or kinesis features. In fact, it may not be possible to upgrade them all in TWO play-throughs.

The only problem, shared by all games of this types, is that on the first play-through, when you don't know how best to proceed, you are constantly running low on health packs, ammo, and cash. Then on subsequent play-throughs, when you understand how to manage these things, you end up with more of them than you can ever use, which makes the game less interesting. In fact, one option after winning the game is to start over with all the weapons and ammo you amassed during the first playthrough, which is no challenge at all, though it is kind of fun just walk around kicking everbody's a**.

Before paying even sub-$20 for this game, the buyer should consider if s/he will be okay with possibly having to replay a really boring mission for 20, 50 or more times.

Now that the PS3 is out, new controllers still cost about $30-$40, about the price for a used PS3 game.

When I first saw this device, I figured ""cool, something I could use so I don't have to go out and spend $30 on a new PS3 controller"". Well, to my amazement, there's a few hitches to the device. First off, don't get me wrong, the device works pretty good on most of the games I have played. All the buttons work just like a PS3 controller would. Here's the catch. The device doesn't add the function of the PS HOME button. (The PS logo button on the center of the controller that's used to help you exit/quit a game or program you are running) This is what got my attention while I was about to finish a game. There is no button that's used to help you exit a program or even be able to switch to another task. The PS HOME button is void with this device. So if you plan to play a game with it, you might want to use this as your Player 2 controller, not your main controller.

The control key is used by Final Fantasy XI to quickly reply to a /tell sent by another player. Since there is no control key one must manually type it in.

The ""/"" key is in green. But pressing the green button happens to make all the text disappear. So to type ""/"" (which is required for just about every chat function in the game) I have to press the green button, then the button with ""/"" in it, then the green button again, then the ""/"" button again... and even then it doesn't happen all the time.

The ' key is also behind green, which is on the other side of the keypad from where it normally would be on a regular keyboard. Which is weird. So I end up using the , key instead.

Then there is no tab key. Which is required by Final Fantasy XI to use auto translate. However, this game is in the onscreen keyboard. So to use auto translate I have to use a combination of the two keyboards which is kind of redundant.

And then chat itself is too sensative. I feel like a snake with a lisp. All the letters double very often. To be fair, this only seems to happen within a game, and not in xbox live messages, but I only really use it within a game.

While the backlit is a nice feature, it turns itself off too fast and can't be disabled when it is otherwise daylight so wastes allot of battery life from my wireless controller. And while having Shift, Green, and Orange, to fit so many more characters than the number of keys, it's still a tedious function.

All in all, I would say that it is fun to have a keyboard attached to a controller, but it is not very practical. For the money spent on this I should have instead purchased a regular USB keyboard and just plugged it into the Xbox directly.

107991,3.0,False,"10 8, 2008",AXKJI57FKQ6YN,B000R0SS3Y,Austin Shau,"Forget about how many years Too Human has spent in development, or how loud-mouthed its nonetheless endearing director, Denis Dyack, has proven over the years. If we're going to be fair to this game, we need to take an unadulterated look at what the game is and does instead of its history.

Let's lay those answers out right now: Too Human is merely decent, and it doesn't do all that much. What it does do is present a loot-intensive dungeon-crawler in Nordic clothing. For those of you who aren't familiar with Diablo, the conceit is this: Choose a class of warrior, each with differing strengths and weaknesses. Then cut through hordes and hordes of peon-style enemies. Then collect the piles and piles of money, weapons and armor they drop. Also accumulate experience points with which to increase your dude's abilities, which can result in any number of damage-increasing bonuses.

It definitely goes beyond the mindless dreck that is Dynasty Warriors. There are tons of ""runes"" scattered about which you can insert into open slots of your weapons and armor, reminiscent of Final Fantasy VII's materia system. These runes serve to increase your damage potential, defense, probability of special effects (such as slowing down your enemy), and more.

So, certainly, there's quite a bit of content in Too Human as far as the collectibles and bonuses are concerned. The problem, though, is in actually playing through the game in order to get to that content. The combat is touted as fluid and accessible. Based mostly around the right analog stick, at first it seems as such. Pointing and holding in the direction of your enemy to attack is as simple an activity as you could hope for in an action-roleplaying game, and perhaps too simple: It starts to feel brain-dead very quickly.

So the game affords you the ability to mix it up by launching enemies into the air, assaulting them with any number of firearms, unleashing a ""Ruiner"" special move (not unlike a smart bomb in a space shooter), deploying your mechanical spider companion to cause bonus damage, and executing a combo finisher.

The good news is that this all remains accessible, as the commands to pull these off are simple button presses. The bad news is that it's mechanically and visually clumsy to launch your enemies into the air, which is a key component of combat. Double-tapping your analog stick to launch isn't difficult, but it just feels uncomfortable, especially given that you'll be doing it quite often. There's nothing pleasant about it. Visually, your enemy just kind of floats in the air while you follow it up and start to wail on it -- as if you're both standing on invisible platforms. It takes some of the physicality and even skill out of air combat, leaving you wishing for the visual stimuli of Devil May Cry -- the original Playstation 2 game that was released seven years ago.

So, you've got this odd phenomenon of mindless, almost boring combat that somehow takes more focus than it should simply because it's uncomfortable. You've also got environments that largely consist of wide open, mechanical-looking rooms. With the exception of some different color hues, everything looks very similar and thus gets old really fast -- just like the combat.

Yet, as with any loot-based game, it remains compelling for the simple prospect of collecting that next great piece of armor or that new sword. I'd personally stopped playing it after one playthrough in single-player and a few hours of multiplayer because the gameplay simply could not keep me interested past slightly-more-than-minimal due diligence, but I can definitely see the appeal there. Tinkering with your weapons and runes is a great time-sink diversion, and sometimes there's nothing better than coming home from a tough day and laying it all out on enemies that don't do much to resist.

In sum, then, Too Human has its merits. It doesn't do much, but if you fit the mold, it does enough. It isn't that great, but depending on your mood, it doesn't need to be.

Gameplay is simple, though it's easy to get turned around in a 360-degree environment, but there's little interaction, and what there is doesn't make much sense.

The flying is a little stiff and awkward to control with your plane going all sorts of directions.  Gameplay is pretty simple once you get the hang of it, which ultimately is the downfall for me.

176442,3.0,True,"05 6, 2012",A6BHE6E9VV5BE,B001G3B0HC,Nishi,"The game starts right off as Kingdom Hearts 1 ended and the story is pretty cool. The battle system makes me think what was Square was thinking at the time. It has the same looks as Kingdom Hearts 2 (Sora still looks like his Kingdom Hearts 1 version though) but doesn't look bad when it's stretched out on newer tv's.

Story:

This takes place right after Kingdom Hearts 1 ended (literally), and follows Sora as he traverses the floors of castle oblivion. Each floor is a level from the first Kingdom Hearts, but it changes around a bit. Sora is slowly forgetting things along the way, so the levels seem familiar to him, but play out differently than how Kingdom Hearts 1 did them.

Along with that, you have Organization 13 running in the way of sora and we get to meet the members we couldn't fight in Kingdom Hearts 2. This is really the strongest part of the game (along with the soundtrack) and its worth finding out what happened in this game, as you get some important scenes at the start and end of the level.

Gameplay:

This is one of the more annoying battle systems I have played in a while. The idea is to take a card based system and apply it to an action RPG, but fail at the delivery of it. I don't mind games that are based on being as strategic as you can be, but I got really annoyed playing through this game. It does have one improvement over the original game, and that is a controllable camera with the right analogue stick.

Battles do start to get annoying because your normal attacks are cards as well. I'm fine with magic, items, and special attacks to be all card based, but I don't like when your normal attacks are penalized by tying them to cards. With all the iterations of the Kingdom Hearts games, this is the only one that doesn't allow you to attack normally.

When you level up you get to choose between Hp, Deck increase (more cards) or sleight (Abilities where you set up three cards in a row). Since the attack cards have numbers on themselves, you don't get increases on your strength so that you hit harder. This throws out level grinding before a boss if you're stuck and it does really take away that RPG feel for me.

One cool thing is how they control the rooms. You choose how the room is set up based on the room card you use (Like one is a moogle shop or a save spot, while another could have a ton of enemies for farming exp). Only problem with this type of set up is that some of the rooms require a specific number or type card and if you don't have that you're stuck farming enemies until you do get it (or use a roulette card to make that farming easier).

Soundtrack:

Just as good as the other Kingdom Hearts games, with the same songs from the worlds you visited in Kingdom Hearts 1. Even though I have heard them a ton already, they really don't get old because they fit the worlds so perfectly. The main theme/song are in the game as well and it wouldn't be a Kingdom Hearts game without them. All the spell animations sound great, and the Keyblade hits sound like they always do.

While the cutscenes in the worlds themselves are only text, the Organization cut scenes before and after each floor are fully voiced and its really cool to finally have voices to the organization members we didn't get to fight in Kingdom Hearts 2. Sora does sound older but this was recorded a while after Kingdom Hearts 2.

Graphics:

This game has the same look as Kingdom Hearts 2 and they really did a good job in recreating the entire game from the GameBoy version. All the summons, Sleights and magic looks really great on this game and even stretched out on a bigger tv. Some parts of the worlds in the story sections look the same, but the random rooms have their own distinct look to them.

Verdict:

The ONLY thing that kept me playing through this game was the story and if you don't care at all about that, than avoid this game. If you do decide to get it, I recommend playing the game twice; it's worth it for story. If you are interested in the story, you could watch a let's play of this game, that way you can find out what happens, without having to deal with the horrible battle system.

383862,3.0,False,"04 27, 2015",A1NQ2AY8S778X8,B00PB9LZQI,Nerrel,"Majora's Mask may not have been universally praised at release, but in the years since it has become one of the most beloved entries in the series. When the prospect of a remake arose fans immediately began email and petition campaigns to show their support, to the point where series producer Eiji Aonuma was inundated with questions about a remake everywhere he went.

Unfortunately, the remake that has finally arrived was not created with devoted fans in mind. It was tailored especially for newcomers, and plays as if the creators themselves share the same disdain for the original that many critics did in 2000. Aonuma has admitted that he deeply regretted many elements of the original and wasn't interested in revisiting the game, and several of the key staff members on this remake never even completed the N64 version. Without any actual fans overseeing the project, MM3D suffers from many inept and often needless changes- whereas OoT3D struggled to update while remaining as faithful to the original as possible, Nintendo deliberately went out of their way to make MM3D into a different game, freely altering any mechanic for any reason.

- To start, the original save system was replaced with the statue system from Skyward Sword and A Link Between Worlds. On N64, players could only ""hard save"" by playing the song of time, which would reset the game's 3-day cycle. The result was that play sessions were demanding and long, requiring players to cram as much progress as possible into each sitting. This system was inflexible and tense, but it lent a faster pace to the game and created a structure for play sessions that always ended in a supremely gratifying way- the player would complete an intense marathon of tasks, then finally save and lock in all of their progress at once with a cathartic return to the first day- saving in Majora's Mask was a satisfying accomplishment unlike anything else in gaming.  The player would then load the game to start a brand new cycle, free to choose whichever quest they felt like.  Should a play session need to be interrupted, the game provided a temporary ""quick save"" at owl statues, which addressed all of the practicality issues that arose with the main save system.

MM 3D completely removes that system, instead allowing unlimited hard saves at owl statues. While this is convenient, it reduces the stress and focus that made the original so immersive. Tension doesn't build the same way when the player can save every 5 minutes,  and playing the song of time has lost all of its impact and reward.  Instead of being greeted by the iconic ""Dawn of the First Day"" screen upon loading, players are unceremoniously dropped in at the arbitrary point they last saved at. Resuming a session is disorienting, as a player can be juggling as many as half a dozen sidequests at once and it's hard to recall every task that was in progress, and it's also limiting in the sense that the player has no choice on loading other than completing what was unfinished last time. A new save system was a sensible addition for handheld play, but the new system isn't well suited to MM's cycle based gameplay and shouldn't have come at the cost of the original mechanics. By not even providing the option to save with the song of time alongside the statues, MM3D loses some of the character and intensity of the original.

- There have also been some regrettable changes to the way Link's forms control. In the original, Deku Link could quickly hop across water and chain spin attacks together to keep his speed unbroken when crossing lily pads. Now, Deku Link runs more slowly and often can't build up enough momentum to reach pads that would have been easily accessed on N64. This makes traversing the Southern Swamp slower and more tedious, as Link's momentum is halted and has to be rebuilt from scratch after crossing each and every lily pad. It's not clear why this change was made, as there was never an issue with the Deku's speed that needed to be addressed, and by failing to adjust the spacing of the lily pads to accommodate the new speed Nintendo has somewhat broken this area of the game.

- Zora Link was originally able to swim like a dolphin, spiraling through water with a feel vaguely similar to piloting the Arwing from Starfox64. Zora swimming brought a level of speed and agility that hadn't been seen before in the Zelda universe, and as a result it became one of the fondest memories many players have of the game; it has long been regarded as one of the few examples of enjoyable swimming controls in gaming history. The only problem was that Zora Link charged forward when starting to swim, which could lead to collisions with walls and nearby objects when in tight spaces.

To address this minor hassle, Nintendo completely replaced the swimming with the slow, human-like style from Twilight Princess. There's nothing fun about the new swimming, as (in addition to its plodding pace) it loses the flourishes like spiraling turns and rocketing jumps that made the Zora feel great in the first place. The original Zora swimming is still available at the cost of magic, but it consumes magic so rapidly that it's essentially prohibited- it can't be used to travel, as even a double magic bar isn't enough to reach any of the destinations in Great Bay before running out (and there are no magic pots anywhere to refill with). Considering that the bay was designed specifically around the Zora's swimming speed, its large open spaces are now a chore to traverse. The Pinnacle Rock segment (which requires magic for attacking sea serpents) is especially frustrating as Zora swimming across the cavernous space means Link will run out of magic and be left unable to destroy the required enemies.

In the segments where the original Zora swimming is required (an underwater race and the final dungeon), Nintendo has added magic pots to allow the gauge to be refilled. It's here and only here that players are ""allowed"" to Zora swim, but with the new annoyances of having to swim out of the way to collect magic pots and Link's electric shield constantly whirring and obstructing the screen. The worst thing about this change is that the slower new speed doesn't even work smoothly in the tight spaces it was designed for, causing frequent camera glitches and taking corners with sluggish, wide turns. It's also not strong enough to push back against the fast currents in the water temple, leading Link to lose control much more dramatically.
It's hard to imagine a more unfortunate and bumbling waste of a great mechanic than this. The new swimming breaks the original, intended functioning of the game and the developers will punish you for trying to use the original swimming by rapidly draining your magic, so whether one tries to use the original or the new slow swimming they will run into frustrating problems. There were so many other ways to implement this change and any of them would have been better than this... were both speeds freely available to use, this change could have been a great addition.

- Compounding the problem with the Zora swimming is the fact that Shiro, an invisible soldier that requires the lens of truth to see, has been moved to the Bay area.  Because the lens of truth requires magic, a player that has drained their magic by Zora swimming will be unable to interact with Shiro at all and instead will have to leave Great Bay entirely in order to replenish their magic, then come back and slowly swim across the bay and go through all the obstacles of the fortress again.  It certainly doesn't help that Shiro has been placed in the middle of a guard rotation and the guards continue patrolling while speaking to him, meaning that the player can actually be spotted during Shiro's cutscene and captured the instant it ends.  The fact that thoughtless oversights like this are in a remaster that had four years of development time is startling.

-The bosses have also received some drastic changes with mixed results. The first boss, Odolwa, has been reduced to a simplistic pattern in which players just have to Deku bomb him from above and then stab his head while he's stunned. It's not difficult to do this- he won't even attempt to attack the player at any point of the process- and once this weakness is discovered it only has to be repeated the exact same way twice more to win... the fight is an uninspired and repetitive chore. In contrast, the original fight felt like a boss designed for those who had just defeated Ganon in OoT, with a much greater emphasis on quick reflexes with no clear formula to follow.

-Gyorg, the water temple boss, has had a new underwater phase added to expand the fight in which mines are used to attack. While the idea itself is great, the method of dislodging and using the mines is clumsy to execute and poorly communicated to the player and the phase drags on a lot longer than welcome. Twinmold, the final boss, has received bigger revisions- in the original, Twinmold was nothing more than a gimmick to showcase the (admittedly cool) effects of the Giant's Mask. MM3D expands the fight with new attack patterns and phases, but even there the changes lead to an awkwardly long and poorly paced battle in which Link spends several minutes standing around and waiting to punch the enemy as it passes by. The painfully long duration of this fight and the poor feedback when attacking makes it uncertain whether the player is even doing any damage to the boss at all. Overall, Goht is the only boss that doesn't feel like an awkward compromise (incidentally, he's the boss that's changed the least).

There are a host of similarly senseless and often unnecessary revisions that bring the experience down, from the excessive hand-holding the new bomber's notebook (which now constantly interrupts the pace of gameplay with unskippable hints about heart piece and quest locations), to extreme difficulty reductions of many segments (Captian Keeta in Ikana Valley now moves so slowly no player could ever fail to defeat him, the Deku palace platforms that once moved now stand still), to the flat out intelligence insults like the new ice arrows (which only freeze specific sparkling points of water). Even the sound is handled carelessly, with goofy new noises inserted into cut scenes and excessive reverb effects added to most songs that reduce the impact and clarity of the original soundtrack. Possibly the biggest frustration is what Nintendo DIDN'T change- the ""Elegy of Emptiness"" had to be played over and over to complete the final dungeon (the player will hear it 18 times before even entering the dungeon itself). It was a laborious chore to keep juggling masks and items while playing the song repeatedly, and Nintendo has done absolutely nothing about it here. Considering how far out of the way Nintendo went to streamline the game everywhere else, to leave the most tedious element of the original untouched is just bizarre. The fact that the New 3DS features aren't utilized is also a disappointment; the extra shoulder buttons could have easily been used for extra item slots, and the added processing power could have alleviated the heavy framerate issues the game suffers when playing in 3D.  Even on the regular 3DS, the D-pad could have been used to permanently house all 3 transformation masks.  Instead, those buttons sit completely unused.

Of course, Majora's Mask 3D does a lot of things right- Grezzo once again delivers beautiful 30fps visuals (albeit with constant framerate drops in 3D), the touchscreen is useful as ever, and the new gyro controls are a tremendous improvement over stick-only aiming. Many small, tedious speed bumps have been streamlined to make commonly repeated tasks more fluid- the banker now defaults to depositing all of your rupees, cutscenes are shortened on repeat viewings, shortcuts have been added to avoid backtracking, etc.  These are smart, genuine improvements that no one could object to.  Regardless, there are too many things ruined for MM3D to supplant the original and become the definitive version it easily could have been. MM3D should be thought of as a Star Wars style ""Special Edition""- a version that takes one step backward for every step forward it brings. Overall, the original is still the definitive experience, even if it's clumsier to play and much less pretty to look at.

This is what the game's director, Eiji Aonuma, had said he hoped to avoid when doing remakes of past games. It's clear he wasn't a fan of the original, and as a result was unaware that the mechanics he was altering may have been beloved by many players. Changes would have been fine if the original experience were still accessible in some way, but it isn't- with the four years spent on this game, an ""N64"" or ""classic"" mode with the original saving system would have been trivial to implement.  The respect for the original content that was so evident in Ocarina of Time 3D is completely absent this time around; instead of being treated as a classic game worthy of a remake, Majora's Mask was treated as a problem that needed to be fixed.  MM3D is still a good game, and will undoubtedly lead to many new players being able to enjoy this unique world for the first time, but as a devoted fan of the original I consider it an inept retelling of a classic.",Not the remake this game deserved,1430092800,8,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Nintendo 3DS'}",
369471,3.0,True,"11 4, 2014",A38EAEOIEWZS0F,B00LH6C8L0,C.J.,"Right now, This game is getting a TON of play time in my One.  So why only 3 stars?  The content is just not there.  This game is meant to be a hybrid FPS, MMO, etc etc etc.  Once you've spent a couple hours beating the campaign (seriously, it was shorter than a call of duty campaign) you are let loose to do... well, honestly, all the stuff you already did.  Only now, you are grinding locations and mobs of gear.  Anyone familiar with MMOs knows the loot grind.  If you liked Halo, then you will recognize the art in this game as it appears to have fallen almost directly out of an unreleased Halo game.  If you liked Mass Effect, you will notice that the load screens are almost carbon copies.  I could point out a couple of other games that Destiny pulled directly from, but you get the picture.  Destiny feels very familiar because IT IS.  This makes it derivative but playable.

The loot grind in Destiny would be alright if it actually made sense.  Here, you are stuck with a random number generator for every single thing you do.  Kill the highest level non-raid creature?  So what, no loot.  Run by a low level and accidently kill it?  High end gear.  There is no reasoning behind the loot system at all.  They've updated the game to include better potential loot from their ""Strike"" missions.  These are missions you already played only now you can up the difficulty.  (The highest isn't difficult because you've already played these 5 or 6 levels 30-40 times already and know them like the back of your hand)

That is the basic theme in Destiny, repetition.  They mask their old missions as new missions by throwing on random buffs and debuffs to make it ""interesting"" but really, you've already done it all before.  Speaking of content... There is content on the disc that you paid for that you will unlock by paying more money.  That's right, at least one mid-level boss, the ""Ultra Captain"" has been found in the game that can only be reached via a wall glitch.  You can play through the level and trigger spawns till you eventually kill the mid boss.  This, it has been insinuated, will be part of the PAID content in the first DLC.

The PvP in Destiny is easy to pick up and is quite enjoyable, but the reward system is again a problem.  A person who essentially almost causes your team a loss by dieing 30 times and getting only a single kill has the same potential to get a super high end reward as the person who carries the entire team.  The system is completely random and just adds to the frustration.  Meanwhile, Bungie decides to devote their time to fixing up a limited time mission set that few people bothered to participate in.

The Story... What story?  Take yourself completely out of the game experience.  Remove yourself from your console completely and hop on Bungie's website.  Link your gamer tag to their website and you will have the POTENTIAL for there to be a story in this game.  This may sound a bit confusing so here is how it works... You play through the campaign in what amounts to 2-3 days worth of casual gaming while Dinklage, in the form of a floating rubics cube, tells you that you need to wait on him and kill random things while phoning in his poorly emoted performance on a poorly delivered story.  After you've completed the campaign and finished the 4 or 5 optional strike missions (think boss missions) you may realize you've been earning Grimoire Cards.  What are these?  The game flashes a quick note each time you earn one that tells you to go to their website for more info.  The problem is that you're usually in the middle of something so you don't really read the message and miss the point.  Assuming you DID read it and went to the site and jumped through the sign up hoops, you must now sift through these ""cards"" on the website to find the story.  It is there, sort of.  If you've earned enough cards you may start to get an idea of all of the things going on in this game.  Likely you won't though.  The cards aren't in any particular order, and bungie, being caught up in their own ego while creating a story bible, felt that the best way to deliver information would be through random conversation snippets taken completely out of context and condensed to a paragraph of text on a card buried in a deck of cards the may not have anything to do with anything.

Sound fun?  Don't get me wrong... the game is actually fun to play it is just INSANELY repetitive.  What will happen is, you will complete the game in a couple days, then spend the rest of your time grinding the same couple of things hoping for the single item you need, all while making fun of Dinkalge's performance and wondering why you have no idea what the story ACTUALLY is.",Meh.

81182,3.0,False,"08 17, 2006",A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000FDOTIQ,Tsanche,"The unfortunate thing about Dirge of Cerberus is that it has the curse of being in the universe of one of the greatest and most beloved video games of all time:  Final Fantasy VII.  There's no way Dirge of Cerberus could possibly stack up to Final Fantasy VII.  To expect any spinoff to stack up to the original Final Fantasy VII name and legacy is unrealistic.  Dirge of Cerberus is pretty different... for Final Fantasy, that is. For your basic shooter, though, it's really not that different from any other shooter.

A group of underground soldiers known as Deepground have plans to revive the dreaded Omega Weapon.  In order to do that, however, they need Vincent Valentine.  Throughout the game you'll play as Vincent Valentine, getting to the bottom of this mystery.  The gold of the story is that it provides quite an interesting look into Vincent's past.  There are moments when the story feels a little complicated, but it's still a good experience nonetheless.

Dirge of Cerberus isn't really an RPG.  Square refers to it as an ""RPG Shooter,"" but in reality, it's really just a shooter.  The game has a rather simple formula for its missions.  You'll view a cutscene that introduces you to the level.  The cutscene is usually long, and you'll have to wait for it to load first, and then you'll have to wait for it to load after its over.  Then you'll go into said level and blast everything and anything that moves.  Then at the end of each level you'll fight a boss.  Rinse and repeat.  Every stage in the game is pretty straightforward.  All you need to do is keep shooting at virtually anything that moves.  In some missions there are other things you can do, but really, you don't have to do these optional events.  They're just there so you can improve your score.  The basic goal of just about every mission is to kill stuff.

A lot of these levels feel a little uninspired.  Most of them are bland looking with not much of anything for you there.  You can't tear apart the environment or anything like that.  It's also sad that a lot of areas in some levels look the same.  These stages don't really show you a lot of variety in the environment.  You'll also find yourself visiting some pretty familiar areas like Midgar.  When you visit most of these familiar areas, however, you don't really feel like you're revisiting anything in Final Fantasy VII.  Also, you'll mostly find yourself in the sewers or something.  It's also really sad that you can't explore more of the world.  The game is set in such a linear path that you can't explore your surroundings.

Going through most of these levels isn't always bad.  Most of the action isn't all it's cracked up to be.  You simply aim and shoot.  The game provides a nice targetting system that makes missing most enemies nearly impossible.  Even worse for the gameplay, there aren't a whole lot of variety with the enemies themselves.  You'll mostly battle soldiers.  Though from time to time you'll battle other things such as mechs and dogs.  Once you've seen one soldier, though, you've seen them all.  They're downed within a couple of shots, and their attack patterns aren't really all that varied.  Before long, the enemies will do the same predictable things they always do.  The game becomes incredibly easy before it even gets a chance to get hard.  When you're near the end of the game, the enemies will still have their same old attack patterns.  They never ever change.  Bosses can be tough, but the only thing that actually makes the bosses tougher than your normal enemy is that they have more health.

In addition, most levels have little in-game cutscenes of their own.  Again, though, you have to wait for the cutscene to load and then wait for it to load when it's over.  These moments wouldn't be so bad if they didn't constantly come in the middle of the action.  One minute you're shooting up your enemies, the next the game is loading a cutscene that might only last for a minute, and then the next your back in the middle of the action.  It isn't that these moments are bad, it's just that they're inserted at inappropriate times.

Using magic also has its own hits and misses.  You can equip materia to your weapon and fire off a magic shot.  This adds some variety to the stale gameplay, but you'll end up depleting your MP really fast.  There's not enough of the magic to go around.  Likewise, you'll find items called Limit breakers which will allow you to use Vincent's limit break for a limited amount of time.  Using Vincent's limit break provides some more fun to the game.  You'll get to rip most of your enemies to shreds, but unfortunately, it only adds more ease to the game.  Even bosses become a cakewalk with the limit break.  Even though it only lasts for a limited amount of time, you'll still be able to take down a boss using the limit break.

Weapon customizing is a nice addition, however.  After each level you have a chance to use the gil you've earned from enemies to upgrade Vincent's weapons.  Throughout most of the game you'll be using the Cerberus, though.  It's by far the most potent weapon in the game.  It's nice to be able to explore and customize a vareity of weapons at least.

Dirge of Cerberus isn't a long game.  It may take you less than ten hours to complete it.  Upon completing it, though, you unlock an abundance of extra missions and such.  The standard game is nothing special, but the extra missions can really keep you busy for a while.  They're a lot more fun than the standard missions, and ask a lot more of your skills.

Graphically, it's hard to judge Dirge of Cerberus.  Most of the environments are pretty run of the mill for the genre.  There's not a lot of vareity or interaction with anything in these levels.  Most levels really aren't that impressive looking.  On the other hand, the pre-rendered cutscenes are beautiful to look at.  These cutscenes themselves look just as good as the movie Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children.  Outside of that, however, Dirge of Cerberus doesn't take the PS2 to its full capacity.  Most of the music is alright.  Nothing great, but good enough nonetheless.  The voice acting is pretty standard.  Not a lot of emotion, but at some points it goes along with the dark mood of the game rather well.  Sometimes the characters not having emotion is what makes the voice acting good at some parts of the game.  On the whole, though, it's not fantastic voice acting.

Dirge of Cerberus isn't really a bad game, but outside of it having the Final Fantasy name on it, there's really nothing in this game that sets it apart from other shooters and action/adventure titles.  The Final Fantasy name is the only real reason to get this game.  It's interesting to learn about Vincent, and to expand upon the Final Fantasy VII universe, but perhaps Final Fantasy should stick strictly to the RPG genre.

The Good
+You get to play as Vincent Valentine
+Vincent's past and story is explained rather well; the overall storyline of the game is pretty well done
+Beautiful pre-rendered cutscenes
+Neat weapons customization
+You get to use Vincent's Limit Break
+Tons of extra missions after the game is completed

The Bad
-Little innovation
-In game graphics are not up to standard for the PS2 or Square-Enix for that matter
-Poor voice acting in many spots
-Environments are bland
-There isn't enough vareity to the enemies, they do the same thing over and over until the end of the game
-The gameplay gets stale... fast
-The stages lack variety and exploration; they're all linear paths
-There's little challenge to the game",Final Fantasy Should Remain in the RPG Realm,1155772800,95,,

293509,3.0,False,"06 19, 2014",AFLD2NSXDMNNG,B00BI83EVU,Hunter Stephens,"So I finished this game a couple of days ago and have not gone back since. For the later months of Spring, I waited patiently and quietly for this groundbreaking game to come out. However, after playing this game for maybe 30 minutes, I quickly found out what type of game Watch dogs was. So this is my review of, in my opinion, a huge letdown of a game.

Watch Dogs, in a sense, is a newer version of GTA with hacking abilities, but sadly, Watch Dogs hasn't been able to improve upon those base controls and innovations. There are many things that Watch Dogs did that GTA did better, such as mission variation, better storyline, easier driving, and, while it may seem ridiculous, having a JUMP BUTTON. But I'll get to that later. To start off, the story in Watch Dogs is basically a book full of clichs. It has a simple, ""family member/friend is killed by bad guys, you set out to get revenge"" type storyline that, frankly, is actually kind if boring. The missions were repetitive, the storyline was longer than it should have been, and it was made of things we've seen in many other video games. Alongside the storyline are the side missions, probably the dumbest part of Watch Dogs, since you so things like stopping criminals, shooting aliens on your smart phone , playing Digital Trips, and crashing enemy convoys. However, while this is the part of Watch Dogs that is most fun, the missions are still repetitive, causing them to loose their luster after a few times you play them.

The gameplay in Watch Dogs was designed to be innovative, but it was most assuredly, a shot and a miss. For a second, think of GTA V... Think of the driving, the shooting, being able to shoot while driving... And now come back and think about Watch Dogs. Watch Dogs has none of these things; the driving is a chore, the shooting is too simplistic for a game of this caliber, and you can't shoot while driving. And to put the cherry on top, you can't jump. While this may not seem like a vital function for Watch Dogs, gives a chance to explain. If you can't jump in a game, they are simply limiting such a simplistic and human action and completely taking it out of your move set. I know it may sound absurd, but once you play it makes sense.

So that's about it really, there isn't a lot to talk about in Watch Dogs, other than to compare it to other free roam games like GTA. I had high expectations for Watch Dogs and it has been a huge let down for me. If you haven't or can't play GTA, this game is an ""OK"" alternative, but if you don't want to make it seem mediocre, don't play GTA before playing this game.  For those of you who but it, I hope you enjoy it while you have it, because after the main storyline is over, the taste of the game quickly drops. Please don't waste 50 dollars when you can go and buy much better game for less than this.

I mean come on, Vincent Valentine (cool name, huh?) is a awesome, well designed character, and the FFVII world is a classic theme based world to make a great game off of - RPG or not.

DoC; without a question of a doubt, was a rushed, lackluster, poorly executed effort by the SquarEnix developers.  With that said, I didn't think the game was ""horrible"" or ""pathetic"" just... poor. It was clunky, and unpolished. There was a lot ""1 shotting"" the enemies, and the boss battles were really lame - even the final boss I beat on the first try - and I played the game on hard mode - not to say I didn't die during the game... but all the times I did die, was because I practically fell asleep at my chair or I was rushing during certain parts of the game and wasn't paying attention to my health bar - basically, the game didn't force me to use my brain or any skill at all. It was just a lot of cut-scenes with some running down hallways and 1-2 shotting enemies, and melee attacking bugs. Just a poorly made game - theres no denying that.

However, DoC's models were very good - and the characters looked very good during the cutscenes - so it did shine in the graphics department quite a bit. And the character art was also very cool - I liked all the new enemies (although Vice seemed a little generic) and the storyline was entertaining, even though it was slowly paced at times. The voice acting department needed some help - the voice actors in themselves wern't bad - but it was the pacing and timing that was way off. In the CGI cutscenes, the lip synching was sometimes noticably off - which is just pure lazyness in my opinion.

The music in itself was pretty ""meh"" - however, it DID fit the game, and thats basically all that matters. Some of the level songs captured the essence pretty well, and Gackt isn't too bad - although I don't really care for his music (not that its bad, I just don't care for it)  I couldn't listen to a DoC soundtrack, like I could listen to other game soundtracks.

I just felt DoC should've been so much more. Something along the lines of a Max Payne, Freedom Fighters, or a Metal Gear. There should've been times when Cloud, Yuffie, Tifa, actually played alongside you, and become AI controlled allies - or vastly open levels or complexes with a little more roaming and exploring freedom. There should've been more gun variances, melee weapons, combos, rare items, rare weapons, summons, and a more intuitive limit break system, and other things like this. I mean the game certainly deserves that type of polish and ingenuity. This game had the potential to be a classic, and Square-Enix didn't even TRY for it. They fell flat on there faces.

To be honest Namco's Tekken entries since the initial release of the PS2 have done nothing but knock this fighter flat on its face, but before we get to the cons lets talk a little about the pros. Tekken 4 corrects a number of Tekken game play issues, but is limited to a shocking 10 players, reducing it by 20 from the previous 30 player staggering TAG entry. Tekken 4 also gives us an extra one-player level fight setting and improves on the graphics and combos.

Tekken 4 provides about 70 moves for each character (with some additional multiple combo configurations) and corrects the TAG fight move-sharing problem meaning that most characters do not share many moves which is good. So if you are looking for more unique moves per character then Tekken 4 has it, however TAG wins Tekken 4 in terms of its lifespan and game play (even if you own Tekken 4 friends will still ask you to put this disc in), so the tag game play makes TAG a better buy. Tekken 4 has solved the old `this character is better than that character' syndrome, which to be honest, has never changed in any game series as some character moves are simply impossible to pull-off with years playing with them, making them hard to win with. Tekken 4 is more balanced and easier to fight with making it a more fluid fighting game. Although Tekken 4's graphics are better than TAG's graphics it is still a tiny bit of let it down, especially if you play something like Virtual Fighter 4. The background/platform disconnection problems with the fighting platform in TAG (you can see the bad anti-aliasing moving out of sync with the background creating a dizzy fighting experience that is unpleasant on the eye) has been solved in Tekken 4 and looks more real with objects that explode and crowds that get knocked over. All great improvements.

However TAG rulez Tekken 4 and this is bad news for Namco because this game is not even remotely close to the kind of quality that they could have delivered on... and believe it or not, Tekken TAG isn't a whole pile better either. The PS2 has not had the good Tekken gamer it deserves which is sham because Tekken is only available on the PS2! This one gets 3 stars because TAG gets 4 and TAG is better.

Pros:

- Better graphics than TAG.

- Better backgrounds with some environmental damage.

- Better character strength matching, easier to control, better moves.

Cons:

- NO TAG!

- ONLY 10 characters!

- Not better than TAG.

Graphics are nice and the races to the top are for the most part on the easier side when on default-normal mode. About a quarter of the way through this game however I started realizing that the fastest car (Bugatti EB110 + engine swap and upgraded to the max = all 10's and 9.9 handling...kills everything) is revealed in one of the barn's. I played the game in a way perhaps many do not. I rarely bought any cars but rather I upgraded what I won from previous races or what I found from the hidden barns and progressed throughout the game without spending much. I bought really only the cars I needed for particular races that I did not have in my garage. I used the cars I won and upgraded those and won the races when I needed to. The problem is...when you have the fastest car early in the game you slowly begin to realize winning more credit money is pointless when you're dominating speed traps all around Colorado with what you currently have. Why then buy more fast cars when they're aren't quite as fast? Then when you get to the top and beat the top guy you pretty much win the entire game and win a ton of money I never ended up spending. The game served it's purpose but after you win it really has low replay value and it becomes an open boring world of well......driving around town.

For the money I'd say it's okay and if you're buying a ""cheap"" headset it's because you didn't want to spend a lot of money and my grandson tends to use this and I didn't want to spend a fortune.  So for the money it's certainly not bad.  The sound is actually pretty decent and it's nice to have a volume control actually on the headset itself.  However, it's started to have issues after just a short period of use.  When we plug the headset into the controller it only ""connects"" about 1/3rd of the time now.  The sound can still be heard but it seems the mic is going out on it.  I figure it's probably on it's last leg and that's not really a good thing after only a few months.

First of all, the computer characters animation can get very annoying, and the game can move very slowly because of it. Once I was starting the game with three computer players, and there was a three-way tie with the dice roll to decide who goes first, and that continued until the forth dice roll, so I spent a few minutes just watching the computer roll the dice. Not only that but they make sound effects that make me want to put the TV on mute after the first five minutes.

The board itself is neat, with my favorite feature being the animated houses and hotels as they are built, and the monorail type railroads. However the unlockable boards are pretty boring.

My biggest complaint for the game, is that while there are different versions of the game available, like a quick game option, there is no custom rule option available, (i.e. to allow double the salary for landing on go, unlimited houses or hotels, and collecting money for landing on free parking.) I don't think that option would be difficult to have added to the game, since I do have those options on my iPod.

23738,3.0,False,"06 10, 2003",A11A8GWG0IXBZH,B00005LABK,Mark Hills,"In 1997 LucasArts humbled the gaming world with the release of Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight, a first-person action shooter that let players direct Kyle Katarn's quest to avenge the death of his father, Morgan and become a Jedi. The game flattened the competition with its near total immersion in the Star Wars environment that had been sorely lacking, even in the original Dark Forces in 1995. For twenty levels you became Kyle, the quirky smart-mouthed mercenary aiding the fledgling New Republic on a mission against Jerec and his cabal of Dark Jedi bent on locating and consuming the power of the Valley of the Jedi. A thousand years ago a great battle between the forces of light and dark saw thousands of Jedi spirits trapped within the valley. As Kyle you progressed in your powers until eventually having to make a choice between Light and Dark. To stop Jerec in order to keep the valley safe or take the power for your own and rule the galaxy.
 Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast is set nine years after Jedi Knight, making it 14 years after the fall of the Empire at Endor, and Kyle has abandoned his Jedi heritage after nearly killing Mara Jade at the Sith temple on Dromund Kaas when he fell to the Dark Side. Still working for New Republic Intelligence, he and Jan stumble across an Imperial Remnant base that appears to be growing gem-like crystals- similar to the ones found in lightsabers. It turns out that a fallen Jedi and the Remnant are attempting create a Force-using army by combining the crystals and the Force. The first couple of levels are also painfully dull and the goals are often poorly defined. After encountering the fallen Jedi Desann, Jan is murdered by Desann's apprentice, Tavion. Secretly, Kyle flies to Rusaan- the secret location of the Valley of the Jedi. There is reasserts his connection to the Force. Reluctantly Kyle must reclaim that which he abandoned, traveling back to Yavin IV, he meets with Luke Skywalker in order to retrieve his lightsaber. At the Yavin academy, Kyle relearns his basic Force abilities in a test devised by Luke before traveling to Nar Shadda to begin his search Desann and the Reborn.
 Game play is much improved over Jedi Knight in many areas, not least of which is lightsaber combat, which is now handled almost exclusively in the third-person view. I had misgivings about this, but having tried it out, I see that it's much better- allowing for greater control and freedom of action during duels. Graphics are not through the roof 'awesome', but very clean and exceptionally well detailed. I have a ATI Radeon 9700 Pro video card, so I guess I expect all new games to be earth-shattering in their visual appeal. Raven did pay close attention to lightsaber duels from the Phantom Menace- giving the ones in the game a distinct cinematic feel, especially when view from a distance in multi-player. Mostly the game is fluid- the visuals flow nicely and Raven manages to overcome one of the Quake III: Arena engine's short comings by producing attractive vistas, whether indoors or out, everything has the right Star Wars-zy feel and look to it.
 Weapons range from Kyle's Bryar pistol, E-11 blaster rifle, Bowcaster and Repeater Rifle, plus new additions like the Tenloss disrupter, which can disintegrate distant targets in sniper mode, an EMP gun for dispatching droids and other electronic devices, a flechette cannon which is just a knock-off of the flack cannon from Unreal Tournament, plus a rocket launcher. Kyle also has access to munitions like thermal detonators, laser trip mines (a la Duke Nukem), and detpacks that can be blown by remote control. All three explosives and the rocket launcher do far more damage than their small, wimpy explosions would indicate. An additional weapon that Kyle carries that I really liked are the portable sentry gun- a cannister that once dropped deploys a blaster turret and begins shooting enemies within its range. Players also get macrobinoculars, bacta canisters for healing, and light amplification goggles. Plus you will find no end of shield and health power-ups through out the levels. One of the game's down sides is that it is difficult to tell when you're being shot- there are no accompanying green flashes or sizzling sound effects as your personal shields take a beating
 The game ships with 10 multi-player maps, customizable Force powers to fine-tune your character. You can even play games without the Force, though it tends to favor the dark side powers. Multi-player games include standard death matches, capture the flag, king of the hill where only one play has a lightsaber and Force powers and it's up to everyone else to deal with it, capture the ysalamiri (the Jedi Kryptonite creatures care of Mr. Zahn). One of the down sides in single-player missions is Raven split Kyle's Force powers between the Light and Dark side. He can throw lightning and choke someone, but no longer has Force Seeing and Protection- two powers that were, in my opinion, instrumental in the first game. I didn't like the addition of Dark Side powers that seemed to be there just to satisfy those players who think the Dark Side is 'kewl'. Raven also has the Outcast version of its Q3 Radiant level builder and other tools, like script managers etc. for creating single and multi-player levels.
 This is an o-kay game. It didn't completely suck me in like Jedi Knight did, but it is a worthy successor. It lacks the impact of Kyle's momentous decision between Light and Dark nor is the story as epic. And strangely, the feel is closer to that of the original Dark Forces than it is to Jedi Knight. Plus it suffers a little too much from console hell like Dino Crisis, where on some levels you must find the key to open the door in order to get to the next key to open the next door. It has some nice animated full-motion video, but nothing like the live action scenes that added so much to Jedi Knight. It is also a hard game- get used to not completing later maps on the first try even on easy 'Padawan' setting, plus some of the jumping can be a little frustrating. I waited a long time for this game and I'm glad I wasn't completely disappointed.","A Worthy Sequel, but lacking overall. 3 Stars.",1055203200,,,

1. You can't use the controller to drive the menu - you have to use the Kinect. My kids are good dancers, but keeping them still enough to use the kinect controller to select menus doesn't work. The controller option is great because we can sit back and select the info / dance / dancers for them.

2. Feedback mechanisms while dancing are not nearly as good as DC2.

3. The dancers are ""human forms"" and are a little creepy. Their smiles are obviously fake.

4. The dance routines are overly simplistic (in DC2 you can go easy, med, or hard). DC2 does a good job at picking up my ""little people"" and giving points and credit for the dances.

Now onto the Xbox One....... it  seems like Microsoft pushed these out without fine tuning them. Thats really my first impression. Receiving this as a gift Im on my THIRD console, and it seems like Ive finally got a good unit now. The first one? DEAD in the box. No picture, no sound, nothing, just dead. The second one? Disc drive was faulty, causing a chainsaw noise, and Id have to manually eject the disc.  Amazon was great about the exchanges here, thank you! Microsoft Customer Service? Lol Yeah.....terrible.

On to the unit Im using now....

Pros-
Picture /sound. Top notch....love the 7.1 audio.
Library- Obvious answer here, Xbox wins hands down on game selection
Setup- was basic, and easy for the most part
Price- Bundle deal was fair at 349

Cons-
GLITYCHY....yeah. terrible quality control here.
Free games are downloads, not cool. Physical copies Microsoft! (who wanted Assassins Creed anyway though?)
Windows 8.1 interface....never liked it, still don't.
Install/waiting process of any new game inserted (hope you have patience, especially if you rent games)
Appearance.....looks like a VCR from the 90s. The 360 looked better!
Xbox Live Gold....still costs around 50 bucks. Gotta have it.

This was an awesome gift, but if I were buying personally Id wait for the bugs to be fixed, and hopefully the quality control to be better.

But....

And this is a BIG but...  Just as in Gran Turismo 5, if you set the game up to play your own custom playlist, it's a total crapshoot as to whether it actually plays your music.  This is HUGELY frustrating because a decent soundtrack can make or break a game.  More frustrating is the random nature of when it actually loads your music.  I have (at times) had to stop a race, then restart it as many as 3 times before my tunes start.  When they don't load, the game defaults to it's own (awful) soundtrack, which if you could tell by my anger, is a sad attempt as racing music.  When I eventually did get my tunes to work during a Championship, they only played for the first 2 races, then it went back to GT music for the 3rd race.  WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?  GT5 suffered the exact same flaw, I expected it to have been addressed in this version.  This really kills the experience that I want to have.  How hard can it be to make a game on PS3 do something that works so perfectly on the Xbox 360?

Also, this game as only been out for about 2 months, and when you first put it in it has to download a 1.2GB update.  What The Heck!  Why should it need to download such a massive update?  Once you download that, and you think you can play it, the game then says it needs to download another update.  Thankfully that one is less than 100MB.  But geeze.  Then the game keeps popping up all this ""how to play"" crap, which if I were a noob, would be helpful, but it's annoying like the tutorial level on FarCry Blood Dragon.  The game should ask the player if they want this direction, because you'll be trying to navigate the menu and it pop up with "".... I already know"" kind of stuff.

If the price is $40 or less, and you don't already own GT5, then go ahead and get this.  But don't pay more than that.  Either wait for the price to drop, or buy GT5, It's less than $20, and feels much like the same game.","OMG, Custom Soundtrack Fail!",1388188800,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Well, I forgot how horrible the NFS physics are, but it's still a fun game, main reason for a poor review is the nightmare deluxe content.  Good luck getting it, actually, it's very easy if you know every single aspect of the Xbox One, which I do not, all I wanted to buy the stupid console for was to pop in a semi-simulator and play that one game only for the console's life span.  I never had a PS3 or 4, I have an Xbox 360 already but never had to enter codes or get DLC etc...  my 360 does what I want it to, plays Forzas 3 and 4 and then just sits there the rest of the time.

So later comes, I grab the code from the card in the box and enter it in the store (I'm not completely inept) on the console itself and immediately the content starts downloading, awesome, I think to myself.  Now, having grabbed a couple demos from the store and seeing as how they all downloaded AND installed automatically, I thought all was well and done.  A couple days later and a few reboots later, still no content, do some google searches, they all show that after you reach the garage and talk to Amy, you can open a free slot and either buy the car for 0 or it will already be in a spot.  Wrong again folks.  Next step, manually hit the quit button (for the game) from the console and hard boot the console.  Nothing.

I remember laughing at my friends who had Atari with their stick graphics as we would wait for George Plimpton to appear on the TV to vindicate those of us who sought a better system than the standard 2600.
Alas, nothing becomes obsolete faster than video games, and unfortunately, it is totally apparent in this compilation.  Specifically the sports games which separated Intellivision from the pack at the time now appear as dated as an 8-Track tape.  However, it is nice to play the games that remind you of better times in childhood.
""Astrosmash"", the space shoot 'em up, is still a challenging blast to play.  ""Bowling"" still is as tough as I remember, ""Skiing"" holds up the test of time fairly well, stripped down, solid and timeless.  ""Star Strike"" looks great (especially in the commericals), but has lame game play.  The list goes on (over 60 in all), most are barely playable by todays standards, that aside, there is some great nostalgia here.
Negatives? Some of the best games for Intellivision are not present.  Mainly because they were put out by 3rd party manufacturers (Imagic, Activision, etc.) Too bad because ""Atlantis"" and ""Demon Attack"" (both from Imagic) were very good looking and fun games.
Lastly, the game controllers on the original Intellivision drew ire even from the most devout of Intellivision fans, and were downright despised by the 2600 faithful.  The mapping of the controls to the Playstation2, to put it mildly, borders on utter failure.  The effort is there (e.g. graphic represenations of the Intellivision 'overlays'), but the execution is just poor.  Better controls, would make this compilation 4 stars.

It showcases very smooth parkour mechanics of running, sliding, ducking, jumping, swinging to build momentum to string together a vast series of coordinated moves to get from one location to the next.  THAT it does very well.  But the game itself is more of a demonstration of those very well programed moves.  The story is rather bland.  The characters are mostly forgettable.  The levels are few and short.  When a sequel is made, they need to DRASTICALLY improve those weak elements - maybe making more of an ""open world"" free-running game with much more interesting characters, main story and side missions.

The protagonist in this game (Faith) is very clear cut.  The objectives and the antagonist, however, are muddled and the we really never fully understand how the concepts of governmental over-control is influencing society and why the free runners are targeted so intently - other than to realize that they represent rebellion.

To make it from one location to the next to discover various conspiracies, the player needs to successfully complete a string of parkour moves.  There are checkpoints along the way, but, even so, there can be 12 to 15 moves you must complete exactly or else you can die or fail and have to completely redo that entire string.  This can get a little annoying and frustrating if you don't like to redo moves over and over again until you perfect the entire sequence.  Those who like the challenge of perfecting moves will enjoy this game much more.

The visual art style is that of a hybrid comic/realistic look - mostly bright and colorful.  This adds to the unique approach to this game.  I could never get the game to operate on my multiple monitors, so I played the game on just a single monitor and the frame rate at this lower resolution was very smooth.  The audio was mostly average with some issues with volume levels.  The cut scenes were noticeable lower in volume than game play volume.  The game duration was below average at around 6-7 hours.

Overall, I would give the game 3 out of 5 stars.  I would like to see a sequel with much better characterization, story, length, and options while keeping the very well done parkour type mechanics.

This particular adventure pits Holmes against a French master-thief, Arsene Lupin, who plans to regain the honor of his country by stealing a variety of English treasures.

The graphics are much as they were for the prior game but what is interesting is the detail given to the actual historic sights. I've been to the Tower of London and it was amusing to see it in the game modeled with great attention to the layout of the place. But the graphics are hardly crisp and the human characters a bit blocky.

The voice-actors for Holmes and Watson are well done and the game captures the 'feeling' of Holmes quite well. Other voice-actors tend to be stilted and at times remind me of people who don't speak English as their primary language. Lupin in particular just wasn't out-rraaaag-eously Frannnch as I wanted him to be.

Gameplay is downright frustrating. Searching for items and figuring out how they go together was enjoyable enough and gave you an excuse to roam. The puzzles on the other hand were designed for those interested in math. Adding, subtracting, multiplying, disguised in lengthy letters and clues is the game's idea of fun. Like so many other reviewers I resorted to the online walkthrough whenever I confronted a puzzle that stumped me for too long.

The game has potential but is far too scripted. There came a point where I KNEW where Lupin was, but of course I couldn't do anything about it. I think a better design would have been several cases with various ways of observing, questioning, and a few puzzles can lead Holmes to victory. Instead, like the Awakened, you are more or less watching a movie with so-so graphics, a half decent plot, and a predeliction for math.

Is the game worth buying?

Yes, but I'd not pay more than $20.00 for it. It has potential but doesn't deliver and instead you end up stuck doing math or getting motion sick because the game doesn't have the bobbing feature we all learned to love post-Castle Wolfenstien 3D and Doom. Why this game hasn't figured it out is beyond me.

So why buy? The whole plot is well done and the end is wrapped up quite nicely by Holmes explaining it in classic Holmesian fashion.

In the beginning, before patch 1.02, money was extremely hard to come by, and buying cars was difficult. But, PD listened and gave us some online races like GT5.

There are some pros and cons to the game. Mind you I haven't got my wheel yet (Logitech G27, Merry Christmas to me), so driving is done currently with a DS3.

Pros-

New and enhanced suspension and tire modeling
 - gives the cars a more realistic feeling especially when pushing to the limit.
 - slightly better sounds (tires, helps with knowing how hard you are pushing the car)
 - more tracks
 - a few new cars (not all are amazing as they lead)
 - better lighting in game
 - more custimizations (wheels)
 - better menu
 - so far the online races, aren't races, but rather single player time trial with friend lines.

Cons

 - all in game races are chase the rabbit. (start in last or close to last and have 2-5 laps to catch and pass first)
 - AI drivers are really bad. They tend to brake really late, doing endo's, crash into you every chance they get, spin you out when ever possible, oh and the rabbit in later races (ib, ia) will draft you and crash into you.
 - Odd how when finishing a race, you care within maybe 2-3 seconds ahead of 2nd place but a minute ahead of 5th-whatever
 - still no livery, but understand some of the reasons why.

Waiting for the elusive track editor.

All in all, a very fun and addicting game, frustrating at times, but if you enjoy driving real life road cars, and some super, its the way to go.

Will update when the wheel arrives and when more patches come....

Update 11/16/14:
Patch 1.13
So we've gotten a few new cars, and a few new tracks. I have been playing with a Logitech G27 since the middle of January 2014.
I will say that they (PD) keep changing the basics. They are always doing something without telling us, sometimes they do tell us. Physics seem to change nearly every update; this is frustrating because it means a re-tune on dozens of cars. And of course they don't tell us what changed, so it is hours of trial and error figuring out how to fix the cars.
The AI has been through many changes, some good, some not so good.
Online play (not the players) is hit and miss. Constant dropping from the lobby, inconsistent physics (car takes the corner just fine one lap, feels like on ice on another). Taking smoke away from some tracks in online. Chat function is spotty, works fine in other games with the same people. Severe glitching on the track, players can't see all the cars, cars jump all over.
Career mode is rather short and somewhat boring, online is the only place to have any fun and set up the races the way you want to.

It still is a fun game to grab any of the cars and fly around a track and to BS with friends, but I am saving up the money for a new PC to get a better ""sim"" experience.","GT 6, The (Glitchy & Inconsistent) Driving Simulator.",1388880000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I only ever rented this game, as it came out way towards the end of the N64 era of video gaming. Nevertheless, it was always an extremely fun game to me and I recently revisited it at a friend's house. Boy, did playing it again bring back memories!

Once upon a time, I would rent this game and play it nonstop. The gameplay is simple yet challenging at the same time, especially once you make it to the optional worlds. Not to mention trying to get the rare pieces of armor in each level is also a fun challenge.

The story: you possess the elemental stone of fire and are on your way home from a long vacation to a hot springs planets where you found a curious looking egg.  Suddenly, a black hole sucks you in and you wake up in a jail cell. The egg hatches to introduce Pommy, who evolves throughout the game based on the food you obtain by killing enemies and destroying boxes. You begin to meet various Elemental Knights (one of which is VERY familiar to fans of the first BM64 game, but I won't spoil it) and a mysterious woman named Lillith. Together with Lillith you attempt to stop an insidious plot to revive a god and, at the same time, destroy the black hole and get home.

The story is excellent, but what was the one problem with the game? It's way too easy to die, especially when you reach the amusement park world and encounter a puzzle with spikes that are incredibly easy to touch and will kill you on impact. And also, unlike many games, the final boss is incredibly difficult. This may give kids who thinks ""It's an E game, so it's easy"" a rough time. The last uber annoyance may be the save feature. You need to beat a level to save. Otherwise you must restart the level, which can be an absolute pain on the last three levels especially.

We also really, really like Little Big Planet racing (for PS-3) and we have enjoyed Sonic and Sega All-Starts (on the Wii).  This game though, for us, didn't/hasn't/isn't hooked us as much as those games.

Control: (3 out of 5 stars) To drive, you have to hold the Wii-mote horizontal (you can use the steering wheel accessory) and you steer by tilting the controller.  This is one of the steering options in Mario-Kart Wii and, while novel and fun, I personally prefer other steering options (like the nunchuk-Wii mote combo) and would have appreciated other options for this game.  That said, I felt like the turning was a little difficult to master and the response time was slow. It is hard to fall of the track but I wish I felt a little more connected to the car when I moved the Wii-mote.

Racing: (4 out of 5 stars) Racing is fun and there is a lot to learn.  One of the unique features of the game is Car-Fu, or using your car to dodge attacks and to attack other racers.  If you've seen the movie, you know that spinning, taking people out, jumping and a handful of other car tricks are used to win races and it is no different in this game.  By flicking the Wii-mote up and down or left and right you can dodge opponents or knock them out of the way, spin them out or blow them up.  While the concept is new and learning the attacks is fun, I found that the controller (more often than not) took my movements as turn commands and I ended up sending my car into spin-outs or jumps rather than dash left or right.  I'm sure with more practice I'll get the hang of it, but in most racing games (Wii and PS-3) I don't have any difficulty executing moves.

Graphics: (3 out of 5 stars) I know this is a Wii game, but it is difficult to discern power ups and speed ups on the course.  A lot of the courses have very colorful roads and while the power ups look different, they do tend to blend in, especially when you are driving super-fast (like from a speed boost).  Also, the other cars, being colorful themselves, are hard to distinguish from the background, making it very difficult to dodge them or spin them out.  It is especially hard to know when cars are coming up from behind and, since a lot of the game depends on your ability to use your car as the weapon, it is difficult to execute attacks and dodge other racers who come from behind.

Overall: (3 out of 5 stars) My wife and I will keep playing Speed Racer, but I don't think it will hold our interest for very long. We usually get hooked to a racing game and play through the story mode, battle challenges and do our best to complete the game all the way.  I don't think we'll do that with this one and will instead move on to something else I'm sure (Sonic and Sega All-Stars Transformed probably).",Just OK,1394409600,,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

Becuse it's the ideal game to play when waiting for the bus, the perfect game when your buddy is taking his time getting ready to go, and the best way to forget how long you've been waiting for your boss in the parking lot.

Polariums flaws are forgivable, and its gameplay rewarding.  First, the control can be unresponsive, and it can cost you.  The touch screen is used to draw a small golden cube across the colored bricks in order to complete a line which will change the polarity of the bricks (switch from black/white to white/black).  However, pull the stylus in the wrong direction and you'll find your line stalled out, or the line is drawn in a way you didn't intend, and this can be frustrating, bt it's part of the games challenge.  Second, I wish there were a few more sound tracks, the ones that have been included in Polarium are good, but with as simple as the gameplay is, I would have liked to hear a few more fashion-show trancey tunes emitted from my DS speakers.

On the good side, the puzzle mode is challenging and addictive, as well as highly rewarding; the completion of each puzzle sees the tiles vanish in a glimmer of golden particles and a jingle sound to announce your success, simple sleek and strangely pleasing.

The game includes 100 templates on which you can design and save your own puzzles, giving the game a little more depth in its multiplayer potential.

Alternatively, the game offers a challenging tetris style play mode that becomes very difficult very quickly, and offers this in a multiplayer option.

Overall, I'm pleased by the simple monochromatic presentation of Polarium, but I would have liked to see a little more variety in the BGM.  This game is at it's best when you have about ten minutes to kill, such as the bus stop, and I reccomend it for the casual gamer.",Time Killer,1167264000,14,,

Apparently the steam version has securom too. Didn't realize it until securom stopped me from playing the game. When it is running can see the launcher in memory through task manager.

The good:

The driving in this game is fairly fun. most of the cars, even with all driving assist disabled are reasonably responsive.
I have no clue if the cars are realistic physics wise as i have never driven a real rally race. This is the first game that convinced me to drive manual transmission permanently.

The car can wreck and suffer damage which is entertaining. They are particularly hilarious to watch when doing multiple roll overs. Cars also can have water and mud splashed on them which can impair driving for more realism.

There is online multiplayer, but i have not used it.

The music played is sometimes also shown on the television in the trailer.

The npc drivers talk during the race and after. They will even scream sometimes if car is in accident.

The tracks and graphics are absolutely beautiful. the cars are pretty as well. There is even lighting changes inside the vehicles which simulate real sunlight very well.

Many various game types exist in the game all of which have their niche and fun factors.

>>In the game type Domination the player has to attempt to keep the best time through out the track. After a number of laps the person who held the timed sectors the most wins. On higher difficulties this can be a very insane task to accomplish. This is played with multiple people/npc's.

>>Gate Crasher is a solo event where the player has a timer on them and must drive through yellow signs to gain more time. The person with the lowest completion and most gates crashes wins.

>>Heads up races are those where rival drivers challenge the player to a one on one event or task them to beat a certain best lap time. one on ones tend to be easy, while the lap times are usually very painful on extreme.

>>Rally racing is the main reason i purchased this game and it is more like a single lap regular race than the standard by yourself race. eight people start at different times and places and race treacherous terrain. its like regular rally racing but with friends. In these the player does get a co-driver to alert them to various road conditions which even include crashes ahead. The co-driver also comments on how good/bad the player is doing. Rather funny going side long into a tree at 60mph+ and hearing them yell ""I SAID KEEP MID!"".

>>Trailblazer is basically rally racing but without the assistant. All eight people still play. Haven't noticed much difference other than that. On one good note these events house one of the best cars in the game, the Dallenbach Special. It along with anything with subaru,ford, or mcrae = easy mode.

>>Landrush (i think) are basically buggy races. eight people, moderately controllable buggies, similar courses as the truck races.
>>Truck races (forgot the official name) are the same as buggy races pratically.

>>Last man standing is where eight people race and after the first lap or so a counter starts. when the counter reaches zero, the person in last position is retired from the race.

All tracks have time trial and free races too which is dandy.

the cars can have various settings to adjust their performance.

The game is basically a big tribute to collin mcrae by many famous (i suppose) drivers who are there to honor him, such as ken block, katie justice, and some other people i can't remember. i wish the game included bios or something of the people in the game. collin mcrae seemed like a pleasant and talent bloke, but only information i saw of him was after taking the mcrae challenge.

The bad:

The VERY BAD: SECUROM.
I am almost lucky as i bought through steam (which is bad by itself), but the retail game has securom. Apparently the russians got starforce. residual mccarthyism even though the government has change? don't know, but I treat securom as a disease. Steam version does not have securom or starforce.

repetitive courses. Most tours consist of racing one way down the course, then back. occasionally the course will have a few parts changed, but is essentially has the same base. This is particularly gruesome on course that i did not enjoy, such as los angeles tours. i've had to race 3 or so races of basically the same annoying course. i found them annoying due to a mandatory high jump that can severely damage a vehicle. race one tour in an area, and basically did them all.

The music gives the game atmosphere, but also is very annoying. The songs are all rock/punk, which isn't bad because of the genre, but tend to blend together eventually. I will admit a few songs are enjoyable.

The human models are a bit lanky. The drivers legs seem a bit deformed to me and the pedestrians are quasi blocky. I play the game at full everything @ 1920x1200. But at least the cars look absolutely delicious.

the customization of cars has been reduced from the old dirt2 and collin mcrae 2005.

Secruom, yes, worth mentioning once more.

Conclusion:

I bought this for 40$ with a 80% discount on dirt 1, so I think i had a fairly decent deal. for 43$ i got 2 games. but alone i think 40$ may be a bit too much.
20-30$ would seem fairer to me as this game is in desperate need of more content. while downloadable content(dlc) is supposedly available, console only i think, they are supposedly only 5$ cheat codes to unlock everything. More tracks are really a must. I'm 4 hours into the game, level 38, have most cars unlocked, and ran out of courses after about the first hour. 20 minutes, the average time of a tour, of viewing the same scenery and same curves is tiring and gives me little incentive to try other races. luckily the game types are enjoyable. I'm glad i still have collin mcrae 2005 (the gog drm free edition). That felt like rally done right. EDIT>> I'm finding myself enjoying the actual feel of driving better in dirt2, but I sure wish i had the courses from dirt1 and mcrae 2005, wish i knew of a way to port the tracks over as i would love to play all the stages from the previous games with the new feel.",Fun but repetitive.,1260662400,7,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

Well, I'm a huge Capcom fan. I own just about every game from RE to Marvel Vs. Capcom 2. Heck I own a Saturn just to play the 4meg Vs titles from Japan. I'm also a huge SNK fan. Mostly Metal Slug and Shodown, but I've played a lot of KOF 97/98.
So, imagine my excitement when Capcom announced Capcom Vs. SNK! A Vs title plus Capcom characters and SNK characters! OMG! This would be the end all of 2D fighters.
Sadly it's not. I miss that tag-team mode. Sure, you can select up to 4 fighters (based on fighter ""level"") but not being able to tag-team is a major disappointment for me. Also, there are no Capcom characters, just Street Fighter. Same goes for SNK characters, just KOF. Would have been nice to have Megaman and Metal Slug :) Or even some characters from SS 2 or 3. Tam Tam anyone? Now the graphics aren't as good as say Street Fighter Alpha 3, the menu system isn't the best for a Vs title and the game just doesn't have the same feeling as other Vs title's for me. The Groove select (select either Capcom or SNK power metering & super combo button selections) and real time metering is very cool however. It's fun watching your score go up or down on each successful hit or block. Plus when you get beat, your score drops down quite a bit! Makes you want to fight even better and more cleanly. Very interesting concept I hope Capcom will adopt for future titles.
In closing, the game should have been titled ""Street Fighter meets KOF"". That would have been a much more truthful title and I probably would have given it a better review.",Average Vs. Fighter - - Wishing for more Vs features,975801600,2,,
354190,3.0,False,"10 9, 2014",AXYJ9QJYS3S78,B00K1JBLNA,Bryan W,"NBA 2K15 is an impressive all-around product. There is a ton of content within, a lot of work has been done to the various modes, and gameplay and presentation remain strong. It's unfortunate then that once again 2K is plagued by server-related issues and with them having created what is largely an ""always-online"" game it's continued reason for concern.

MyCareer - Still my personal favorite mode in the game, it's compelling even though the story is silly, you're forced to be a guy who's a jackass, and the voice acting is atrocious. I still keep going back to it regardless. This time around the story is based on being an undrafted free agent fighting for a spot on the rosters and working your way up in the league. Conceptually it's strong but also makes you think they went this way because your player starts lower rated and with less playing time so you'll want to spend money on VC to compensate. Having a practice gym to shoot in and the new way of upgrading attributes are positive changes.

Face Scan - This is the most infuriating feature I've ever attempted to use in a sports game and after nearly an hour of trying to complete it I've just given up. It has worked for some people, so it's not ""broken"" necessarily, but it hasn't worked well (see all the alien looking scans out there) or at all for many others. Considering some bought a camera just for this purpose or had it as their most anticipated feature of the game this year, that's a huge problem.

MyPark - This is a great concept for online but the servers and other issues (like standing around in ""Got Next"" and even getting stuck there and having to restart the game completely) makes it a rough experience for now. It has a lot of potential though.

MyGM and MyLeague - Good options for fans of franchise modes. MyLeague is all offline so the servers can't impact it. MyGM like MyCareer has the VC ties to the server so a connection is required to make any progress.

MyTeam - The servers for MyTeam have been down almost completely since release. Some have squeezed in at times but also found their progress completely wiped out after server crashes.

Gameplay/Presentation - Nothing too dramatic in limited standard games so far different from last year. It's still top of its class in both regards in the genre, though commentary has lagged a bit and isn't improved over last year (especially since Steve Kerr is still in the booth). A new shot meter has gotten mostly positive response from the community.

Reduction of VC - One of the big takeaways from NBA 2K14 for 2K was they had to draw back on their invasive implementation of VC. So there's now the MyLeague mode which doesn't involve it and the pressure in other areas to spend money just to play the way you want has been reduced. Still VC is the majority of the game is ""always-online"" and may be the culprit behind much of the server issues. Consider just how often the servers are pinged by millions of people earning and spending VC constantly.

Right now though it would be difficult to give a flat out recommendation for this game. Until the server situation clears up, which with 2K14 never completely happened so it's not something that should just be assumed will take place soon or guaranteed to happen at all, it's a great game that isn't always available for you to play when and how you want - and that's what makes it most frustrating. That great game is just out of reach.

Like Atelier Escha & Logy, it features two characters that you choose between to play. If you haven't played the previous two games, then the deeper storyline may not make as much sense but you can still play this game without having played the other two since they still include tutorials for the players in the beginning. This series places its focus upon alchemy if you didn't know. Whereas the Arland series showed the potential for alchemy in a more hopeful setting, the Dusk series seems to show a darker or bleaker side of it.

 If you haven't read the summary, this game takes place several years after the events in Atelier Escha & Logy in a different area where the Dusk Sea is a large expanse of sand and people travel via sandships. Dusk is considered an event where plants don't grow, water dries up, and basically people must scrape by in order to survive in a harsh environment. Two girls both nicknamed Shallie, Shallistera Argo and Shallotte Eliminus, are budding alchemists who eventually become friends and try to learn more behind Dusk as well as a way to prevent precious water from disappearing.

Shalliestera Argo is the daughter of the chief of Lugion Village who travels to the town of Stellard with her childhood friend and bodyguard Kortes and his father, Teo, in order to seek assistance for her village. Coming from a small village where everyone is like family, she is at first overwhelmed by the people and culture in Stellard. Before she can gain assistance, Shalliestera must first gain the peoples' trust.

Shallotte Elminus has a workshop in Stellard but she doesn't have any big dreams for becoming an alchemist, rather, she has a vague dream of someday making it big. She is enthusiastic and cheerful, taking on tasks to make enough money to get by.

There were several reasons why I couldn't give this game a higher rating, but I want to go over some things in this game. If you haven't played any of the games in this series, then you can skip over this for my overall review of the game if you want. I will be going over some of the ""mechanics"" or the gameplay for people familiar with the series.

Time: Unlike previous games, there is no time limit set in this game. You don't consume days with synthesis, travel, or gathering. You also don't need to nap to replenish Magic Points (MP). You can complete tasks in any order and you can progress the story as fast or slow as you desire.

Life Tasks: In this game, in order to gain bonuses and progress the story, you fulfill these. Each chapter has some main tasks that must be completed and then once done, you are given free time where you can complete as many as you want to gain some bonuses like combat experience or synthesis experience. There are no time limits for completing tasks.

Searching: Like in Atelier Escha & Logy, you have only a certain amount of blocks allowed for equipment such as bombs or medicine that the Shallies use in battle and each item has a select amount of uses in the field. At some point in the game, your equipment is replenished when you return to town which is a great feature I'm glad the creators added into this game. Also, they have the Field Events where you can gather things all at once, fight strong enemies, or find relics.

Combat: Like in Atelier Escha & Logy, you have all the characters in your party plus one on reserve so you don't have to go around recruiting one over the other. Also, you has assists which means characters in the backline can attack and switch with a frontline character. Included is a burst gauge which, when filled, allows for higher damage and chances for chaining attacks.

Synthesis: They changed up the system of synthesis again. While most things are the same from game to game, the process changes. I can't really get into the specifics without saying everything and nothing at the same time so you can either experience it yourself or watch a video on it.

Imbuing: At some point in the game, you will be able to create the different weapons the characters use in combat in a process known as imbuing like in Atelier Escha & Logy. However, it costs money this time. You can also dissemble items which also costs money but you can gain some items for imbuing or synthesis.

In this game, you can choose the difficulty level to change up how you want to play the game, whether you would rather focus on the story or focus on combat and leveling up or just in between. There are some characters from the other two games who make appearances in this game such as Keithgriff, Escha, Solle, Wilbel, and Harry, with some mentioning previous characters here and there at times.

CONS
-Dialogue and/or story seems a little fast, stilted, or odd at points. It just seems like they sacrificed some of the story in favor of adding as many gameplay options they could and focusing on graphics but it's not a big issue; I just focus on the story more than most people

-Text is small in places and hard to read clearly (not everyone has a giant screen tv, come on!). It's not really critical. However, since the text is small for the Life Tasks, it's a little hard to read what I should do to complete one of the tasks. I wished they included an option to enlarge the text

-At level 40, there is a growth system which I just found out glitches. My game froze when it went into it for Shallistera and it seems that the text wasn't even translated; it still had the explanation in the original Japanese! DO NOT OPEN the growth system and you can still pretty much get by in the game

-Leveling up is kind of a pain. You get very little experience points from monsters, instead you mostly get big bursts of experience through completing Life Tasks which can level up your characters tremendously, yet at the same time, when you want to train for a big boss battle, it's ridiculous when you get single or only double digit experience points from monsters

-It's kind of annoying that in free time, once you've fulfilled enough of the main tasks, you are basically forced into the next chapter. I like to take my time and complete more of the lesser tasks and it's just annoying that every time I go back to the workshop, that pop up box asking if I want to proceed to the next chapter keeps showing up.

There are some more cons but they're mostly just opinion-based anyway and it's up to you to decide on whether to buy this game or not. I was a little disappointed in this game and I wished they had taken the time to really flush it out considering it is the last for the Dusk series.

Overall, the game was alright. I actually really enjoyed the gameplay and story in Atelier Escha & Logy the best though so my opinion may be a little biased.

However Rockstar have not made the game particularly user friendly or accessible for the PC market. To start with, you have to install a utility called GTA Social Club which requires you to register details on the Rockstar website. This is the front end to start the game, so you cannot avoid the process. This is one of the first games to support the extension of Microsoft Live from the X-Box 360 to the PC. You must therefore have a ""Live"" account and the latest version of the software installed to start the game, even if you have no intention of using this facility either. I found that by default, the installer ""embeds"" Social Club so that whenever you start the PC, you get the GTA Social Club sign in box appear after it boots up. Now it appears this can be disabled but it is cheeky, invasive and presumptous that you want to run this software every time you start the PC.

This is one of the highest specced PC games released to date. At a time when very few games are optimised even for dual core processors, anything less than a Core 2 Quad will fail the recommended specification. It will run on so called lower spec machines but with the detail settings turned down. Some serious issues with optimisation therefore.

Once up and running, I found my PC (E8400 @3.00Ghz, 4Gb RAM, 8800GT 512Mb Graphics) could run at a setting of 1680 x 1050 (max res for my monitor) at medium settings. It doesn't actually look too bad. Much sharper and more detail/better viewing distance than the PS3 version I previously owned and reviewed. As with previous GTA's you can use both mouse/keyboard and the XBox 360 controller for movement. Keyboard assignments can be changed but this is a bit trickier as you now have to allow for the mobile phone. I prefer to use the arrow keys rather than WASD but Up arrow activates the phone so currently thinking how to re-configure.

I found the controls a bit trickier than on the PS3. Walking via the keyboard, Niko needs a rather large turning circle. Driving is still tricky due to the implementation of more realistic physics and I found even slowing right down I was swinging wide at corners. This does not bode well for some of the time limited driving or ""chase me"" style missions that come later in the game.

Gameplay appears to be identical to the earlier console versions, that is to say cut down from previous GTA's with your in game actions much more story driven. Yes, the friends and schmoozing via the mobile phone are all in there along with the in game internet.

At this initial stage I am not displeased with GTA IV on PC, once it's up and running. However two stars are coming off for Rockstar making us jump through hoops to install (and play) the game and the very poor optimisation of what should have been a straightforward PC port.",Tedious Install - Killer PC Required - But Still Reasonable Game,1228262400,12,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
72312,3.0,False,"10 13, 2005",ABCKTG6GQUSNU,B000AOEUNY,Lord Kayoss,"...which honestly ain't so great.

The reason why:

I think of all the games I loved from the very first time I played them.  It didn't take time to adjust to things I didn't like.  It didn't take time to brave a tough learning curve and master awkward play control.  Those are the games that stuck right away and became instant favorites.  One of those favorites was NCAA March Madness 2003 for PS2.  The play-control was very user-friendly.  The pressure sensitive buttons were very smooth and responsive and firing off 3 point shots and rocking the rim was essentially easy to do.  Provided the game's defense engine wasn't very effective outside of the 1-2-2 press - MM2003 was a very fun and addictive basketball game.  As a matter of fact, I still play it and prefer it over every college basketball game that followed since.  I absolutely hated 2004 and nearly despised 2005.  Both were sluggish and the actual in-game play control reminded me of an old NES cartridge.  But 2005 introduced an all-new Dynasty feature which sparked a huge intrigue on my part and made me want to check it out.  I rented it, forced myself through the sloppy play, and ultimately returned it to Blockbuster the next day and went back with 2003.  EA lost out on my bucks for the second year in a row.

So why did I end the boycott with 2006?  Good question.  I guess I was looking for something new.  MM2003 was finally starting to get old after nearly 3 years.  The Dynasty mode in it was well done but pales in comparison to the newer additions.  All the Dynasty features from 2005 are back and intact in 2006 plus some new quirks.  You have so many points to use when recruiting, training, and disciplining players as before.  But now there is an added focus on different aspects of training.  For instance, after viewing the scouting report for a tough opponent you're about to go up against who's inside defense is tight and threatening, you can spend Dynasty Points on emphasizing 3-point training to increase your shooters' accuracy and overall ability to light it up from behind the arch.  The possibilities are wide and intriguing.

It also costs you points to discipline players who have committed an NCAA violation of course and there's always been alot of belly-aching over that one as critics blaspheme every aspect of that.  But all of them have failed to mention is that you can now turn player violations ""OFF"" in Dynasty mode so no more worries there if you'd rather not deal with drunken college kids hitting the town and being subsequently benched when you need them.

As far as the commentary - this is mainly just a basic rehash of previous years.  A couple new Nessler-anecdotes here and there.  And Duke Vitale (er, I mean Dick Vitale) finally has laryngitis in this one which makes listening to his silly, cheerleading, ""60-something-year-old-man-trying-to-be-trendy-and-hip"" commentary a LITTLE less irritating.  But for the most part the Nessler/Vitale remarks are pretty much spot-on with the action on the floor.  And if they still get to you as always you have the option of turning them ""OFF"".

Then, there's the main flaw - again the in-game play control is tainted with lackadaisical shooting sensitivity.  Holding the shoot button down and sending your player into the air feels like you're still playing Double Dribble or Arch Rivals.  Hell, the play control in those games may have been better!  Shot fakes almost never work and usually leave you open for silly steals which almost always leads to the opponent's unstoppable fast breaks.  Funny thing for a game that boasts so much about defense.  The computer is all up in your face up and down the court most of the time which brings up something else I can't stand.  The chance of your shot falling through the hoop is severely reduced when a defender is even standing near you.  I've missed more 3-point shots in this one than any other basketball game I've ever played.  And when viewing the shot stats after the game I see that Taquan Dean from Louisville (one of the top 3-point shooters in the nation) went 2/19 in 3P attempts throughout the contest - something ain't right there.  And it gets worse.  I played through 10 different games last night against teams of every caliber in terms of quality.  Didn't seem to matter if they were ranked 1 or 190 - I almost never got the bucket when my best scorer shot from right under the hoop!

Is the defense in the game that good!?  Maybe for the computer.  I've bricked enough good looks to cause the head coach to crap right in his pants.  And when it's my turn to guard the cpu opponent I might as well walk into the kitchen and grab another beer without pausing - because one way or another they're gonna score.  Whether it's by breaking through a trap or crashing the boards for a second, or third shot attempt.  The lockdown stick helps in many instances like opening up possibilities for steals and drawing charging fouls, but only if your man is a solid defender - otherwise forget it.

Floor play calling was also alot easier in 2003.  '06 takes about twice as long again leaving you open for steals and/or backcourt violations.

But - after all these gripes I'm still playing the game and somehow having some fun with it.  By getting used to the play control and accepting the challenge to win under uncomfortable circumstances the game is slowly proving to be a decent purchase.  I mean if you're a big b-ball fan how bad can it be?

I was super excited for this one which looks awesome based on reviews and the story is really unique compared to the the other games in the series.

This really bummed me out. I even went to Best Buy to see if I could upgrade my video card, but no luck. Looks like I'll be skipping out on this ND along with any future titles for a while unless I decide to buy a whole new computer.

This game is way to easy. If you like to explore the world before doing the quests, then I highly discourage you from buying this game. Everything is pretty much closed off until you do the quest associated with that specific location.
Some of the higher level creatures in specific areas are very strong and hard to kill if your level is relatively low, but don't fret, you can just run circles around them, or just jump on a rock and shoot them with your bow for 10 minutes to kill them.
I will admit that the upgrading weapons system is one of the best. You can literally break down every kind of weapon or armor that you find, and use those materials to upgrade your weapon or armor of choice. Also, any weapon that you breakdown with an elemental status on it, or a skill, you can add the skill or status from that weapon to the one of your choice. The weapons and armor gain slots when you level them up and you put the skills and status' on them. The weapons and armor also grow stronger on their Atk-Def Ect.
The magic system is pretty cool, but pretty useless. The spells are original and the fact that you have to combine different kinds of spell cards to make spells is very different and I like it, except for the fact that the only spell I ever used was for stamina. I pretty much killed everything with double-wielding a blunt weapon and a slashing weapon and didn't really need magic but only a couple of times to defeat the bigger demons in the swallows with a strength spell. Alchemy is pretty much needed to beat the game easily, but if you are thinking of using any jump, or water walking potions then they are pretty useless as well, being there is really no where to jump to that's interesting, and walking on water will get you across to the other islands, but there is no use in going there before you open them up in the game via portals because everything is pretty desolate and non-active in the storyline and locations.
There is not that much strategy to this game at all, but it was still really fun up until the ending.
I beat the last boss pretty easy with potions, and then the game lets you continue to explore and finish any sidequests you might stumble upon. There is a ton of quests to do, so if you want something to do for a couple weeks that'll keep you busy then this is a good purchase and pretty fun.
This game does have some glitches, but they are pretty minor, but frustrating if you like to explore every inch of your surroundings.
If you choose to stray from the roads and trails then you will find mountains that hover over the ground, and you can literally walk underneath them(this seemed to only happen in the swallows), you will see vast areas on the map directly surrounded by rock structures, and even though it might look like there should be something in the middle, you will only see a vast open space with grass and no purpose for that being put there in the game at all. Not to mention that really big island that you'll be looking forward to going to the entire game, only to find out that you can only explore the edges, and transport to a swamp almost directly in the middle of it(the swamp is part of the storyline). If you want to swim around the whole island then you will find various tribes of fish men to kill and some loot, but there is nothing really there but experience. If you try to climb over the mountains to get further into the middle of the island then it will restart you somewhere else whilst a message pops up on the screen telling you that you have strayed to far from the path.

Dragon Age: Origins is one of the best RPG's of the last decade for sure, and it stands to reason that BioWare/EA should try and cash in on that success. It's safe to say that ""DA: Inquisition"" is fairly good, it has an excessive amount of content, and while not as stellar as the original, it is a fresh and well made game.

The story of Inquisition is pretty standard fare; the player character takes the roll of a ""last-survivor-chosen-by-the-divine-blah-blah"" and the game branches out from there as you build up power and attempt to solve a mystery of who-killed-whom & why you're the last survivor.

Combat is decent, there are a few options as far as skills go with additional subclasses later on to spice up the tedium. Mostly while in combat you will be swapping between characters, popping potions (no healing spells in this game!?), holding the trigger to deal damage. Over all, the game-play IS fun and you won't be bored, though MANY of the quests are very simple (i.e. fetch, kill elite, clear area).

There's also a mass of side content that should keep you busy for hours and hours; included in the side content, is a simple but fun multiplayer (4player mission co-op, does not affect single player), immense item and weapon crafting, special timed missions to send agents out on, a large number of special monsters and dragons to kill, etc. The multiplayer was very entertaining with friends, and while the ""free to play with micro-transactions"" model is off putting, there's still enough access without spending a cent to enjoy it fully.

The largest Con for me is the near removal of buildable ""A.I."" for companions as in the last 2 games; the wonderfully complex commands and variables have been replaced with a less than perfect (but mostly functional) idiot's version that works but leaves so much to be desired, which can make some of the harder modes a bit of a chore. The so called ""Tactical Mode"" is piss poor and nearly useless except to catch a slight break in the action.

Beautiful graphics. It is like I am in a movie where I am in control. Especially the water. Crystal clear, seems as if I am really swimming throughout the deep blue sea. Acres of grass, city scape is breath taking. I literally will just walk around and tour the open world just to enjoy the life like visuals of this game.
Physics of the game are spot on being realistic.

Wing suit and parachute give you great heights and help you explore during game play. These are upgradeable as well as your retractable hook shot.
Explosions are everywhere! Create mayhem against the enemy as you blow up s*** with rocket launcher, grenades, oh my!

Cons:
Alright, once again the load times are horrible. Takes 2 to 3 minutes to load. If you die or are going into a mission or challenge, prepare to take a bathroom break or video game unrelated as you wait. This is 2015. Can we please establish a way to prevent load times being this long?
Game play is repetive and can become dull. Shoot, shoot, fly, fly, chute, chute, boom, boom. You get the picture. Nothing interesting here to a seasoned gamer.
Story is not that interesting. I don't really care much about the characters involved in the story. There is really no emotional grasp for the player to actually latch on to anything.
Nothing to look forward to. The whole idea behind getting a game is to look forward to doing something worth wild in the future missions or story. Seems you just continue doing the same s*** over and over again with different weapons, upgrades, vehicles.
Vehicles like motorbikes are a pain to drive. They feel way too sensitive to turning and hitting a small rock has your character flying into a field.
Guns are annoyingly the same. They don't feel different when upgrading.
There is no easy, intermediate or hard difficulty. Not smart to have a lack of this in your game. It can piss off hardcore gamers if it's too easy and push away beginners if it is too hard.

My friends could not hear me no matter what adjustment I made.

After 3 days of watching the polk website telling me that the issue was in the firmware and was NOT a hardware issue.  They also said that an update was coming to fix the issue in the coming weeks.  I then got an email a week later telling me that if I would go to the polk audio website and register, I would receiver a free ""mic upgrade"".  It is also listed in the product description here on Amazon but they did not bundle it with the headset, you still have to go online and order it.  (although it's free).

Overall the sound quality is excellent and the built-in mic is non-functional.  In order for it to become a true ""chat headset"", you need to get working mic replacement (NOT UPGRADE)...

Harrison,"I am new to the GOW franchise and have heard great things about the games, but was unable to play them until now as my PS3 is not backwards compatible.  First, I would like to say to parents, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR CHILDREN UNDER 18.  The game does contain some nudity and suggestive themes and is very violent.

I was impressed by the game play and graphics.  It was like Devil May Cry meets 300.  The games contain killer combos and a great upgrade system, but there is one thing about the game that bothered me.
I consider myself a fairly good gamer, but there were points in GOW that frustrated me to no end.  Even changing it to easy did not seem to make a difference.  For example, in the Hades level you have to climb up rotating pillars, while blades are rotating around.  Sounds simple enough right?  Wrong, you touch one and you fall all the way down to the bottom and start over.  This is just one of many frustrating obstacles.  With that being said though, for some reason the game compels you to keep trying and eventually get through it no matter how many times you have to try.  I am starting on GOW II now and so far so good.

PROS:
-Great graphics and story.
-Good control.
-Great value.

CONS:
-May be too difficult at times for some gamers. I would definitely recommend this game, but beware if you are just a casual gamer.  The quest will not be easy.  If you like this game you may also like the Devil May Cry series if your PS3 is backwards compatible.

The profanity is something that probably turns away most audiences, because most of the gamers are young and probably need parental admission to get games.

Since there are no online squad-based game sfor Gamecube, the focus is on the single player mode, which is actually good. The levels are varied, but are fun to play through. You can get assault rifles and rocket launchers, as well as handguns. Split-screen play supports 4 players, but isn't all that exciting. If you want a multiplayer game, try TIMESPLITTERS 2.
As for problems, there are a couple. First, there is no online play. Sega did it with PHANTASY STAR ONLINE, so why can't anybody else? Second, the camera sometimes moves awkwardly, which makes aiming harder. Also, the camera gets worse in split-screen. If you are not willing to learn the levels, CONFLICT can be very difficult at times.
There is only one other squad-based battlefield game on GAMECUBE, GHOST RECON. It focuses more on taking cover in the bushes, and giving your team directions. It is also a first-person game, while CONFLICT is a third person game. CONFLICT focuses more on action. THE SUM OF ALL FEARS is a primarily indoor game, so it is not really in the same genre.
So which game should you buy? CONFLICT: DESERT STORM is really your best option, with GHOST RECON a close second. However, if you have a PS2, buy SOCOM first, even if you can't play online.

I seem to remember Sears selling it for $70, which in retrospect seems like highway robbery even in the youth of videogames. It came with a cool poster though. I first was exposed to CT by renting it from Blockbuster. Some guy had renamed all the characters. I remember the guy renamed Magus to Doom. I bet that guy thought he was real cool. The first night I owned the game, I obsessively played it well past my bedtime. I had my dad print off a really long guide from work. He even put it in a binder for me. I took it to school and read it whenever I got the chance. Having repeatedly played it, some of the music made an impression on me, and now I sometimes listen to jazz.

The question is whether this game is just a meme, or if it stands the test of time.

I don't like JRPGs, so pardon me if I'm biased here. They stop you from exercising any creativity over the development of your characters for some reason. There have been times when I hated CT because I thought it was basically the precursor to visual novels, which I hate.

There are extremely few chances for role-playing. In the interest of avoiding spoilers, there are 2 major decisions that occur in this game, and you get blindsided by them, if you ask me. They're the most impactful parts because the game does tell a competent story, and your decisions are affecting characters whose drama you're already heavily invested in.

But CT does allow you to examine your party's stats, change equipment, decide what accessories to use. Actually, there's little scarcity when it comes to items until the latter part of the game. ""Tabs"" are a cool idea, especially considering there's a new game plus option, so you can give the main character all the Power Tabs in your first run, and then give them to someone else your second time through, if that's your thing. Accessories are the most interesting thing here because you never sell them, and they make a substantial impact on how your characters work. There's even one that puts a character into a permenant berserk state. You won't be able to use any of their ""techs"" but they hit much harder than before, and their turn comes around more frequently.

It's nice that you end up with a variety of characters to put in a party of 3. Some of them are magic-intensive, others are more melee-intensive. Some can heal, some can't. It's too bad that despite your chances to switch out this member for that, you have no idea what's going on in a dungeon beforehand. You just have to go inside and see what's up.

The boss fights generally make sense. None of them are beyond your comprehension within a few tries. Some of them have special weaknesses, should you choose to experiment. Gimmick is considered a dirty word these days, but I wish more of the bosses in this game were like puzzles. The final boss isn't much more complex than one of the bosses you meet earlier in the game. He, she, or it just hits a LOT harder and has a LOT more HP.

Nevertheless, you'll find challenging fights, and you'll need to use multiple techs and items to get through them.

If I had it my way, you'd have multiple success states in this game. For example, if you beat a boss in a certain way, you'd get more or less XP instead of simply making the game easier. The same goes for regular enemies. It would also be nice if it could somehow track your performance, however you'd like to measure that, and spit out a high score screen. Yes, this is an RPG, but it is a linear RPG. Yes, there are multiple endings, but there are a finite number of endings. It would be nice if you could challenge yourself over and over, which would extend the game's usefulness beyond the content itself.

At the end of the day, the game's presentation makes it pleasing to go through. Maybe even comfy. As far as JRPG stories go, it's a neat little story that, when you think about it, carries its theme in places you wouldn't expect. Every character has a single thing in common, which I won't spoil here, but I might say something in the comments, if someone asks.

I liked that you could play it with stealth or just go in Chow Yun-Fat Style and kill everyone. It looks very impressive on some boards when you're in a massive crowd lurking to assassinate someone. The pain in the game is the disguise system. It works but the logic behind it is bothersome. NPC are constantly able to make you out in some of the most unlikely scenarios. For example, when the police respond to a call and you take a disguise they can make you out to not be a fellow officier if you get to close to them for too long. In the middle of a major crime call with let's say 40 cops they all know each other from different precincts? The same can be said for all such disguises on different levels.

It doesn't break the game but it's a flawed system. They could have made you pick a disguise that fits your MO or have you select a loadout for each mission. Choosing tools to help you accomplish your goals. Disguises, Distractions or Devastation. The story is nothing to get excited about but the voice acting was excellent feat.

Dead Space it is not, and that's too bad because Aliens Colonial Marines really had the opportunity to be the ""Co-op Dead Space"" that everyone wished there was. (Dead Space 3 does have co-op but frustratingly not split-screen.)

Clearly&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2008-s-Dead-Space/dp/B000X1TC0U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2008's Dead Space</a>&nbsp;succeeded and was so outstanding because it was NOT co-op. In Dead Space you're alone; it's creepy and you feel vulnerable (and scared!) during every single moment of the game. Unfortunately, Aliens Colonial Marines is not even close to that; in fact it's just the opposite. In Colonial Marines you're rarely alone; the isolated, creepy feeling is just not there and you feel like someone has got your back for most of the game.

But Aliens Colonial Marines is FUN!!! I play co-op split-screen with my son and we are enjoying it thoroughly. My son is 12, and color me a bad parent, but he's seen Aliens dozens of times and I'd say he's an expert at the game Aliens vs. Predator. So between his comparison to the AVP game and my experience with Dead Space (the best game I've ever played), I think that when we say that Aliens Colonial Marines is a good, fun game we have a little credibility.

Fans of the movie shouldn't expect a story-rich continuation of the film. You'll hear some familiar voices and see a lot of familiar images, but don't expect much more than that.

The graphics in Aliens Colonial Marines are not so good; graphics are way inferior to Dead Space and AVP--which are, what?...5 and 3 years old respectively? AVP was also a SEGA game, so it's surprising that a 2013 game would be not up to par with that. Much of the gameplay in Aliens Colonial Marines seems outdated (like the ability to carry every weapon at once, and the way ammo and other items are lying around all lit up with literal signposts marking many). The game almost has the feel of an arcade game from pre-PS3 days...and that's a while back.

The weapons are almost all super powerful...especially the shotguns. The enemies are mindless with no strategy required; they just come right at you for the most part. On a normal difficulty you can rip through the worst enemies with ease and probably finish the short campaign in a single Saturday afternoon sitting.

Online co-op and multiplayer options are there but I'll leave those to my 12 year old son. He played multiplayer last night for about 3 hours and said it was just as fun as AVP online, although as I alluded to earlier he added that, ""The graphics aren't as good as AVP."" Like the game it's FPS when you're a soldier, but when you're an Alien it's 3rd person.

My recommendation is check this game out if you're a fan of the movie and shooters, but check it out when it's not 60 bucks anymore. This one should have gone to market at 39 bucks tops.

Are they gone? Good. That game was overrated anyway. This is a modern FPS brought to us by the capable hands of Starbreeze Studios, the same people who brought us those cool Riddick games from last generation. Their mark shows in this game by making the game play more compelling than the fiction with high levels of immersion throughout the five hours or so you play. Single player is action packed, throwing you into multiple high-impact situations, attempting to keep the action from getting stale.
There are some interesting hacking abilities that allow you to do horrible things to other people, but with only three versions of these powers, you find yourself wanting more before the game ends. There is plenty in the single player experience to enjoy, with boss encounters that require you to use cunning as much as trigger, and a few surprises when the scenarios make you gun from atop a train, ride a zipline into another apartment, and much more. The story, unfortunately, is trite and plays it's hand too easily. Characters are by the numbers, and while voice acting is good (hey! that guy from the Crow!) the characters are about as one dimensional and predictable as it gets. Big twist? Not bloody likely. So for the 5 or so hours you play, you'll enjoy the ride (even if you keep screaming to your character ""say something, damnit!!"") I'm getting so tired of the ""silent protagonist"" fps games are making us play these days....

Multiplayer is only a co-op affair. And its good. Real good. Get three friends and complete varied missions together with highly customizable and upgradable characters. It's like an action-rpg hidden in a standard fps game. Create your own clan, see the rankings go up...wait, there's almost no one else playing. Well, the game is cheap now, so buy yourself and three friends a copy, otherwise the awesome co-op is unplayable. It's worth doing if you can.

To better illustrate this, the game does not really incorporate much cutscenes but rather leaves the players chatting with each other while still leaving you in control of the player allowing you to walk into the far wall and seemingly converse with the wall if you so choose and it also makes it hard to really get a feel for the emotions and dialogue because the camera does not zoom in to show facial expressions and body language etc. Strange design choice but if you are in the mood for a JRPG and do not have anything else to play then give it a shot.

Over the course of this game I have seen some really bad flaws. I will tell you the worst for me. If you want to fight an enemy in this game you will have to pause this game. The click area around an enemy is too small. I have seen a lot of complaints about this one.  You have to pause, click on the enemy, and then unpause to fight.

My question is where are the puzzles to solve? NWN one had a lot of puzzles and quest. NWN2 has a few quests, which were very annoying, and no puzzles to solve.

162140,3.0,False,"06 15, 2012",A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B00178631E,A. Whitehead,"Max Payne 3 sees the return of the titular hero after a break of nine years. Remedy Entertainment, who made the first two games in the series, have moved on with their Alan Wake series of games, leaving Rockstar (best-known for the Grand Theft Auto series) to carry on their work. Whilst fans of the earlier games were dubious of this move, it was actually reasonably logical. Rockstar games often feature damaged protagonists trying to live better lives but being drawn back into a life of violence by circumstances, which is a perfect fit for Payne.

The game acts as a reboot of the series. References to the events of the first two games are minimal and, aside from a couple of flashback missions set in New York, the game is set in a different city in a different country with a very different culture (not to mention a different and un-translated language). The only constants are Max himself and, of course, his ability to slow down time to engage in combat.

Max Payne 3 is overwhelmingly impressive from a production values standpoint. The graphics are fantastic, with the game employing a vivid visual style. Keywords from conversations flash onto the screen and sometimes the action dissolves into line breaks and the colour desaturates, almost like you're watching the action on an old 1980s TV that is about to expire. The game's colour palette tends towards the bright and colourful, but there is a dark hue to everything. Sections set in crumbling warehouses or an abandoned hotel contrast the light and dark elements of the game's style. Animation is astonishing, with Max storing his weapons on his person and moving them around naturally to swap guns or take painkillers. The game feels like it's had a million dollars spent on every single minute of it (in sharp contrast to the low-budget feel of the first game, with its amateur cut scene actors).

The game's centerpiece is action and gunfights, and the title impresses in these areas. Combat is hard, fast and furious, with effective use of bullet time necessary to proceed. The game also employs a cover system, one of the more tiresome elements of modern action gaming, but the use of bullet time and headshots makes it mostly an optional feature with only a few moments where its use is necessary to proceed. More satisfyingly, the ludicrous modern gaming concept of 'regenerating health' has been thrown out of the window and replaced by Max's more familiar use of painkillers, adding a great deal of tension to the action sequences and requiring the player to plan attacks more intelligently than just charging in, knowing you can hide behind a box to get your health back. Unfortunately, bullet time has been gimped since the second game. There's only one level of bullet time (you don't get additional slowdowns when you shoot more people) and, ridiculously, it doesn't regenerate when you make kills. Given it is fairly slow to regenerate, a fair amount of combat has to take place without the use of the game's central mechanic and main selling-point, which seems strange.

The writing is okay, though Dan Houser's script is notably less funny, knowing or introspective than Sam Lake's work on the first two games. But it's reasonable and House deserves some props for moving Max on in his life, continuing his character arc and trajectory from the first two games. The other characters in the game are somewhat less successful, with no memorable equivalent to say Vladimir Lem or Mona Sax, but they do their job well enough. The change of setting is far more successful, with So Paulo (or, rather, the criminal underworld that is the main setting) presented as a dark, threatening city which is a perfect match for the semi-noir stylings of the series. This is backed up by the soundtrack (by American band Health), which is excellent.

So the game is well-made, with amazing production values, a decent story, some good characterisation and great action (if not quite as well-executed as the first two games). But there is a major problem. You see, the game doesn't actually like you playing it very much. For every minute you spend actually playing the game, it demands that you spend at least another watching it play itself, through intrusive use of lengthy, unskippable (as they hide loading sequences) and non-interactive cut scenes. Cut scenes are not just present at the start and end of each level with maybe a few reserved for major moments mid-level (the sort of structure the first two games employed), but they take place near-continuously. Frequently, opening a door will trigger a cut scene showing Max going through the door and taking cover before letting you resume control. This even happens if you've already flown through the door in shootdodge mode, resulting in frustrating (and continuity-breaking) moments where you could have wiped out a dozen bad guys in five seconds in bullet time but the game demands that you hide behind a counter instead and fire from cover. Cut scenes often kick in after you've dispatched the last bad guy in an area, taking you to a new area with no opportunity to loot the enemies for ammo (which is in fairly short supply throughout most of the game). There are also too many moments when the game has Max doing some really cool things (like diving between moving trains or jumping from an exploding rooftop onto a helicopter) when you don't have control.

Max Payne 3 is, of course, a linear action game and railroading is to be expected. Certainly the first two games had a lot of cut scenes and moments where player choice was taken away, but generally it was in areas where it made sense. They were also infrequent compared to the amount of time the player had control. Max Payne 3 actually seems to resent you doing anything other than what it wants you to, and punishes you if you try. During a shoot-out near a plane taking off, any attempt to jump onto the plane will result in a cut scene where a bad guy kills Max with a grenade, with Max standing there and unable to do anything. During a battle on a river dock, falling in the water will result in Max's instantaneous death, despite him being able to swim in a cut scene a minute later. Despite Max's ability to slow down time in gameplay, in a cut scene he runs into a room where a friend is being held hostage and is powerless to stop them being executed, despite the fact that if you had control you could wipe out everyone there in moments. The game also employs a checkpoint system rather than allowing quicksaves, resulting in the player sometimes having to repeat 10-15-minute long sequences if they are killed, which is simply unacceptable.

When it actually lets you play it, Max Payne 3 (***) features some intense and engrossing action sequences. However, the game makes the classic mistake of placing itself and its story (which is decent but nothing special) ahead of the enjoyment of the player. As a visual experience, Max Payne 3 is impressive and intermittently even brilliant, but as a game it's a frustrating let-down compared to the first two titles in the series.",Amazing moments of gameplay buried under mountains of cut scenes,1339718400,21,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Plot was decent. The flashback style of story telling may be convenient for the developers but it got old the first time I saw it in Black Ops. They also have a problem making the interrogators seem real - most of them would have been reassigned or fired in the real world, a movie plot, or even a TV drama. They were appropriate for a pre-teen cartoon. Am also getting tired of being yelled at the by game characters (any game) telling me to ""HURRY UP"" when there really isn't a strict schedule that needs to be met. If you could tell them, in game, to STFU I might feel differently. It just isn't the same shouting it out and getting a side eye from the missus.

Game installation sucked along the lines of problems reported since the game was released 2 years ago. The thrill of having to scroll through pages and pages of Google hits for BF3 problems never gets old. In my case it was the evil ""not a valid win32 application"" error for any executable on the DVD. I had to copy both DVD's to my computer to install it. Had never seen that error before on my 7 year old Vista system.

The inevitable update from Origin took a long time too. It is not a welcome sign when installation starts on a Tuesday and finishes on a Wednesday. There were also a few crash-to-desktop events.

I played the original first game back in the day and thought it was moderately entertaining and kept my interest for a bit of time.  Diablo III is merely the same old game spruced up but just hasn't evolved for the modern gamer.  If you like collecting hundreds of useless items for the sake of it and the occassional keeper until it becomes quickly deemed obsolete as you level up, this might keep your interest longer than expected.  You can boil it down to go to a stage with access to other smaller stages, find items, and hit the same few buttons for special powers a million times over.  There is no strategy or technique required.  It's just hit, hit, hit, your enemies and kill them. The game continues to pile on ungodly amounts of demons but once you make it into the lvl 30 area, you can equip special skills that basically make potions useless and you'll stay alive to keep slashing away whether there are five enemies or 100 on the screen at once.  The more that come on the screen at once, the more it just becomes a chore to clear them all out.  You just get too strong at the previously stated levels to be killed and this takes away a lot of the fun first found in the initial few hours of gameplay.  Now you can of course increase difficulty to do just that but it really didn't change my perception of the overall game.

There are some nice elements of the game like the overall look and storyline.  Furthermore, there are different classes of characters but my one and only is approaching lvl 50 and I find little desire to redo the whole thing with a different one.  I will likely just trade the game in for something different very soon when I complete the storyline. It's just okay, a bit boring, and probably won't hold your interest too long.

I recently purchased Diablo for PS (Mine still works... Take care of your stuff kids and it'll last a long time). Never played DII.

And it was such a big deal then 6 months from now, the price of the games themselves would not drop by 50%. I'm just sayin. I want to play this offline, while I'm taking a break from my studies. Requiring even solo players to be online because you're afraid a group of people don't want to pay $60 for the license, but enjoy the game, is gonna cost you more in bad press and legitimate sales.
 I like the cut scenes. If you, as a consumer, like the cut scenes, too, then play through in solo mode. During online play, anyone in your party can skip the scene. I missed a vital piece of the story because some impatient, dipshi...person skipped the cut scene.

 Lastly, and keep in mind I'm only on the first act, I don't see any side quests. Side quests are a good thing to have.

For someone like me that plays casually, has a life, other things to do, is into the genre, and has patience, I recommend getting this when the price drops.

124292,3.0,False,"05 18, 2008",AOP2ZRNSHY2Z3,B000ZJVDA2,Andrew D. Lossing,"It had been awhile since I'd dug into a traditional Final Fantasy type turn-based RPG. The last was FF XII, which was an experience right up there at the top of the scale for video games. Naturally, then, I had high hopes for this ""next-gen"" game from the minds of the FF crew.

I turned out to be a little disappointed, though. Lost Odyssey has none of the polish that made FF XII what it was. Voice acting is surprisingly mediocre, the world is not as fleshed out (although it is still better than most RPGs, a la Final Fantasy), and the combat system is somewhat archaic. Much closer to FF X than FF XII. Why the creators should choose to abandon what was such a winning system is beyond me.

In truth, there is nothing at all next-gen about this game, excepting only graphics. They're very impressive, and beg the player to zoom the camera to take a closer look (which is always rewarded with high-res models).

But there is good to this game. The premise, which pits immortality against mortality, and illustrates the ""blessing"" of mortality (an ability to pursue specific goals and dreams within a finite amount of time - something this current culture kind of needs to hear) is intriguing, and the flagship character's struggle with this is meaningful. The dreams also, while possibly too much for some players, can be touching. This game tries to tug at the heartstrings and makes a theme of human nature, and at its best it does that well, making it powerful enough to remember. Unfortunately it doesn't always do so well, and some aspects are surprisingly unrefined.

This is a game which needed more work, pure and simple. Is it a meaningful piece of work? Definitely. Is it a little disappointing? Yes - unless your gaming standards are not very high. If Final Fantasy XII had not risen to shine over and above this game in almost every aspect, it could rest comfortably with my recommendation.

EA would never do this with The SIMS2. In this case, EA either lets you digitally download Simcity Socieities: Destinations or you can buy it in the new Simcity Box. Now granted you would think that The Simcity Box would include all the Simcity games from the original to the present one; Simcity Socieites (along with the expansion). This is not the case. Those people who already own Simcity Societies will have to either digitally download Destinations or buy Th Simcity Box. For those people who don't own Simcity 4000 and its expansion, Rush Hour, this is a great deal. You got to wonder what EA was thinking.

In the Simcity Box you get Simcity Societies, its expansion Destinations, Simcity 4 and its expansion Rush Hour, SimCarnival: SnapCity, and the trial version of Spore creator creator. All for $[...]. As I said before, if you don't own Simcity 4 and Simcity Socieites, this is a great deal. If you do, then it's best that you get the digital download version of Simcity Societies: Destinations on EA's website. Strangely it's $[...] which is a pretty hefty price for a expansion ($[...] less than the Simcity Box). Those who don't trust the digital download will buy this. So people will just pay the extra $[...] and buy the Simcity Box. Still, not a lot of choices given by EA.

In the Simcity Box, the highlight is Simcity Socieities: Destinations which is the first expansion for the new series; Simcity Socieites. Remember that Tilted Mill had thrown out everything that was built from Simcity (the original) to Simcity 4 and its expansion Rush Hour. Very bold move. Unfortunately, Simcity Societies angered a lot of people and Simcity diehards were very ticked off. Casual gamers liked it as well as others. In Destinations, it includes all of the updates (total of 5) that tried to increase the playability and fix the bugs. The overall meaning of Destinations was to create a vacation destinatation. This I thought was very intriguing. It was unique and would certainly help Simcity Societies to try to win back the Simcity Franchise diehards and try something new. Tilted Mill certainly tried something new at the beginning.

In Destinations more scenarios were added (although not many) ranging in difficulty. You were charged to create either a small vacation destination to a huge Las Vegas type of vacation megaplex. If you choose not to play a scenario you can either play in a sandbox mode where you are free to create and have everything unlocked, to a strategy mode where you have to be mindful of your building costs, maintenance, and unhappy sims which can create havoc on both your city and funds. The strategy mode was an update after Simcity Socieites shipped, so if you gave up on Simcity Socieities you missed the update. However it is included on Destinations. As I stated before, all the updates are included within the expansion Destinations. If you don't want to play in strategic mode, you can choose the difficulty, what type of land you want and how it might look (look at the preview screen). Do you want a desert, tropical, tropical coast land area? You also can pick up to three special landmarks that can have an effect on your tourism which also would effect your city coffers. Cha-ching! Cha-ching! Your main task in Destinations is to create a destination worthy that will attract SimVacationers. Will you build a beach resort? Las Vegas type of vacation spot? Will it have casinos? Minigolf? Motels? Shops? Tents for camping grounds? If you have accomodations for your tourists, you must have venues which are split up into adventure, dining, entertainment, gaming, leisure, and worship.  Which kind of tourist do you want to attract? Can you satisfy all of them?The expansion adds taxistops, bustops, subways, airports, and seaports. Remember, how are your tourists going to get to your vacation spot? This is an exciting new perspective within Simcity Societies and brings in some much needed new content. Now for the bad:

Frustrating! Unfortunately, none of the bugs were fixed. The different socitiet values can be too much and it's very vague concerning their importance or why there are here in the first place. I've mixed a few including, spiritual, authortarian, and productivity; nothing happened either in a bad or good way. In other words, what's the point? The graphics of the buildings were nice. Yes, they produce that, or help this, but so what. Again what's the point. If I placed a few buildings that put me in the red, then I just added buildings that add value until I was in the green. In City Life, some of the social values couldn't live near each other. The game gets very slow when you build up your city. The graphics are very nice however, when the sims cross the street, they turn into invisible lines and reappear when they reach the other side....very wierd! The manual included within the Simcity Box on Destinations is not good in explaining all the new ideas and added goodies within it. The frustration factor is still present even when you want to create a vacation destination. A tutorial would of been nice for Destinations. There is none. The only tutorial that is present is the one for Simcity Socieites and even that one is very incomplete, vague, and not as helpful as Simcity 4 and Simcty 4: Rush Hour was. I wish that there was a type of helper that can guide you to help you move along and give you pointers. **WHEN YOU START A NEW CITY, IT'S LIKE YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN AND GOOD LUCK, which I think a lot of people will feel when playing this game. In Simcity4 you had the advisors. While they weren't a great help, they had decent advice. It would be nice to create parking lots, parking structures, malls, shopping centers, putting in parking meters (for revenue and the addition of a new character in your city- the always warmly greeted ticket agent---cough cough :-) It would be nice to walk or drive around your city either as a civilian, a police officer, a fireman, a mailman, or a tourist. If you walk around as the mayor, will you be greeted with handshakes or tomatoes? One thing I really miss is what I enjoyed in Simcity 4: Rush Hour concerning building up your transportation network. I would of loved to be able to have an effect on traffic control either directing traffic if there was an accident, power outage, or construction, and/or creating traffic flow using the traffic signals. The one thing I hated in Simcity 4: Rush Hour was how bland the traffic signals were and at times it looked like cars were stopping at a red light while others didn't. Controlling traffic would be an awesome feature. It would be nice to be able to place stop signs, street signs, signs in general, traffic lights (single or multiple), and turn signals. I also miss one-way streets as well as avenues. It would be refreshing to see your police keeping the peace and pulling over cars that are not following the traffic and parking rules. I would be nice to see cars parking, and entering and exiting driveways and parking lots and/or parking on the street. How about the possibility of you being voted out as mayor? Will the city council loose faith in you? Does Parliament give you the boot? Are you being investigated for taking bribes and/or kickbacks? Will the people keep you in office? If you are booted, you can become the new mayor but you have to change your policies and try a different root. If you get booted again, game over! How about a weather and natural disaster engine that is random. Earthquakes, severe thunderstorms, hurricanes, and tornadoes that can hurt and destroy; forcing you to send out the police to keep the peace, fire engines to stop the fires, rescue vehicles to tend to the injured or killed, and then set out to rebuild. I would of loved to have more city policies (Simcity 4 had more).

There were some good things within the new expansion but the game still is frustrating and still needs quite a bit more content and bug fixes. Then, just maybe all will be forgiven. I still haven't given up hope. Sadly, when I play Destinations, I'm not on it that long because it's just too frustrating and not as fun as Simcity 4. I get all happy thinking what kind of destination am I going to create, then it fades.

SnapCity is bad although it might be appealing for kids. Anyone who doesn't have Simcity 4 and Simcity Societies should get this, it's a good value. Simcity Socieites has improved but there is still more room for improvement. If it blended City Life, Simcity 4, and Simcity Societies together, then it could of gotten the seal of approval of most Simcity diehards. I've been playing Simcity since the original, and I still have hope that Tilted Mill will improve it. For now, Simcity Societies is still a letdown. While not as bad when it first was released in November, it still needs some work. Maybe this is practice for Tilted Mill. I would love to see this game go DirectX10 (or the new DX11). I would also love to see a city management game that would blow even the Sims and Civilization franchises away.

Something to look forward to is the upcoming release of Cities XL. I've played the demo and so far it's way better than Simcity Societies and mixes both City Life and SC4k with a multiplayer (hybrid MMORPG) aspect to it. I've preordered it. If amazon doesn't sell it, I'll somehow put a review of it on here. Im posting this because city-building fans should watch Cities XL. It's got some kinks but it has a great tutorial- something ScSocities was missing. It's even more fun that it lol. No, I don't work for the company that makes Cities XL. I'm just saying this to spread the word for people who were disappointed in SimCity Socieities. Something to look forward to :)

Update:

While Cities XL seems slightly unfinished, when I was in the forums adding what I would like to see in it, the developers were mentioning that the ideas I was listing are on the list for later updates and expansions. The graphics are gorgeous on Cities XL. The system requirements are steep. You need a pretty powerful video card also. I wish Cities XL was offered on Amazon, I would write a review. Im playing it more than SC4k. I would say that it's a small notch below SC4k however, any updates and/or expansions would go above and beyond. Basically, if Cities XL adds a ""Rush Hour"" type of expansion, it would be sooooo much better than SC4k. Likewise, if SC4k had the graphics from Cities XL, oh how beautiful it would be :) Email me if you'd like to know more about Cities XL before you buy it. Oh and no, I don't work for anything related to Cities XL lol. Im a big fan of city building simulation/business sims and strategies.",Nice try but not good. I prefer Cities XL!

This game manages to not have (at least in my opinion) a single one of these things. The music is redundant and not particularly inspired (unlike the x-box version which is a bit of an improvement). The graphics are pixelated (much more than the other console versions) and no where near state-of-the-art. The controls are okay, but not terribly intuitive.
The cinematics are REALLY pixelated, just sub-par for what this system is capable of. But what really kills this game is the very thing that makes for a good shooter, REPLAY VALUE. The game is VERY short, and new missions can only be unlocked by accomplishing irritating objectives (like collect all of a certain item, or tag all of a certain vehicle).
There is no real incentive to replay levels. Unlike most classic shooters, there's no cool grading system, and no high score rankings. In short, rent this one before you buy. That's my recommendation.",Rent before you buy,1031702400,4,,

I'm semi-torn for a good review for this because I do have a semi large hand, and it feels really awkward to use claw grip with this mouse, which I do.  I really dislike the placement of the thumb buttons because that attributes to some of the difficulty (with a gentle grip I can claw it and not accidentally hit buttons) but it still feels strange.  The ring finger rest on the side doesn't get used much due to my preferred grip, and when I do, it does somewhat help me grip the mouse easier. Problem is, I HAVE to squeeze with my pinky and ring finger fairly hard to secure a good grip on this mouse when I decide to move it (I don't have the best room for my mouse).

Other than that, the LEDs are nice, and basically blue is a requirement for any mouse that I own now, I have had some issues with certain side buttons not functioning exactly when I push them, but otherwise, I really only NEED 6 side buttons.

It was a decent price point, and corded keeps me from having to change batteries in the middle of anything, the braided cord is nice and the length is good.  Accuracy on this mouse is good.

35028,3.0,False,"04 13, 2003",AWXPAJ7VG5D4Y,B000067O0P,Phil L.,"I agree with many of the other 3-star reviews of this game.
As a new player, I downloaded the demo and instantly got hooked. I zoomed to level 30 (level 150 seems to be the current cap), and had a wonderful time exploring new systems, trading supplies, and fighting weird mobs. The universe is immersive, and the NPCs have interesting tales to tell and missions to give you.
However, after a week of playing, the game began coming to a real grind. Those once fascinating, far-off systems have already been explored, and the trade routes are now routine, and you have to do those routes twenty or thirty times over to gain a single level. Once explored, there is little risk trading or travelling, as you simply warp between waypoints and most mobs can't interfere. You just wait until you reach the next waypoint, gate to a new system (which are always protected by high level friendly mobs), and warp again to your destination.
When you dock at a starbase, you now approach those interesting NPCs only to break the monotony, hoping you're in the mood to do whatever roundabout, 30-minute, across the galaxy mission they're currently offering (usually for a tiny bit of extra EXP).
It's an expensive monthly payment for a game that isn't half the multiplayer quality of Dark Ages of Camelot or even Everquest. Different genres, but basically the same type of game.
Combat and grouping is very awkward, and even after weeks of play I still have trouble targeting mobs or ""healing"" groupmates. There is no Player-vs-Player combat and the faction system is very difficult to break away from - unless you have a powerful, high level ship you'll always be a Good Guy. You won't become a true pirate anytime soon.
The game shows promise, with continual additions to the universe and a sort of ongoing storyline (which just kicked in the past few months, but so far has no real impact on gameplay).
Player to player communication is especially difficult, and hopefully the weird chat system will be fixed soon. You can't see levels or class of other characters (even in your own guild) unless they happen to be in the same Sector as you, and the chat windows have difficult to read fonts and non-adjustable screen positions and transparency... regardless of what resolution you run the game at. Inside starbases, I found myself constantly facing gray or black walls just to read my conversation windows.
Graphics are great (but lag even on high end systems), sound is good, and the interface - once you get used to how it works and what icons mean what - is servicable. Beware that the perceived fun of zooming through levels wears off after the first few days of gameplay. Then, the dreaded ""grind"" sets in.

Gameplay is fun, and the variety of weapons, scenarios and situations kept the game interesting for longer than I expected.  I picked up my used copy of this game at Gamestop, and while I was first very annoyed at having to buy the DLC ""The Taken King"" in order to get to level 40 and be able to pick up all of the cool, interesting gear, I did find that the DLC gave a good amount of value for the $20 I spent.

On the other hand, a lot of the missions seem overly difficult for on person playing alone.  Nothing much happens when you die, but if you already expended your heavy ammo in the first attempt, when you come back, you don't have that heavy ammo and your second attempt will be more difficult.

One of the things I disliked about the DLC is that a lot of the missions seem overly-scripted, which is contrary to the enjoyment of an open-world game like Destiny.  The joy of open-world games is that I can go where I want, when I want, and do what I want there.  In one of the DLC quests, I jumped around a ledge on a tower and there was a guy waiting for me there who pushed me off the tower and killed me.  I didn't loose anything but a little time, but that kind of scripting lessened my enjoyment.  In an open-world game, theoretically the characters are going around, doing things that would benefit them, instead of standing right inside of a door all day, just waiting for someone to jump in front of them.

After finishing the main quest with a Titan, I tried a second playthrough with a Warlock, but the differences in the character didn't seem to be enough to enjoy playing the game a second time.

Even great gaming houses can't do this -- and folks, even on their best day, Obsidian would never be accused of being great.

Ultimately, for anyone who has played Doom 3, Half-Life 2, or Painkiller, or almost any other FPS title coded for PCs, SWK II will be a big disappointment.  The real problem is that it does not have the logical user interface and natural character interaction with the game-space that games designed for the PC have.  And because SWK II doesn't feel and look as real as the titles previously mentioned, the gameplay is dramatically compromised.

My bet is that this game was rushed to market as part of the massive merchandising effort surrounding Star Wars Episode III.  And it suffers from the same thing that most of Lucas's recent efforts suffer from, and that is that he and his team have clearly made the decision to trade quality for speed to market.  And they have done this to the degree that the Star Wars franchise has been all but made a joke (case in point: Jar Jar Binks).  This is almost heart wrenching given Lucas' contribution to the sci-fi genre and to entertainment in general in the late seventies and early eighties.

Plot

You are an ignored teenager, whose sister falls under a Pig Latin curse...and this dire circumstance forces you into the spotlight. Your Father calls upon the spirit of a bottle to cure his Daughter...unbeknowst to any of you, he has summoned forth Evil King Stanley Hihat Trinidad XIV, who reigned as the tyrant, Evil King Gohma, 300 years ago. In exchange for curing your younger sister, Evil King Stan possesses you, and orders you to help him restore his reign over the land. Thus, you must travel o'er the land, disposing of typical villain archetypes who have come to power during the course of Stan's absence. In the course of your journey, you meet heroes, scholars, princesses, and other RPG character archetypes, composing the stereotypical rag-tag band of outlaws. After all, you'll need all the help you can get...those evil kings aren't going to go down without a fight...

Graphics

The visual style is meant to be a tribute to that of Tim Burton, the guy who made A Nightmare before Christmas. Henceforth, everything looks Goth and Halloween-esque. The atmosphere can be described as ""Halloween in every season but Autumn."" So the atmosphere is BOTH cheery AND dark.

Sound

The music is silly, but fitting for the backgrounds. In some cases, it is even good for listening pleasure outside the context of the game. They try to make the music sound Irish in places, with bagpipes and flutes. The sound effects are what you would expect to hear in an RPG, with some other humerous sound effects like the kazoo and such. Some of the fanfare themes sound like they were taken from the Super Mario Bros., and the Evil King Marching theme sounds reminiscent of Bowser's theme.

Gameplay

The battle system is semi-real-time, semi-turn-based, as you have ATB gauges, like in recent Final Fantasys, but once it's a character's turn to attack, action pauses, and you have to choose your attack before another character can. If you're not sure which action to have a character take, just select ""wait,"" and then cancel that ""wait"" once you have decided upon a course of action.

You can choose to combine your attacks with other party members (synchronize your attacks, thus more than doubling damage rather than attacking alone), or you can exploit enemies' weaknesses by casting spells of an element they can't stand.

One greatly irritating thing about the battle system is, if your main character falls, it's an automatic game-over. In which case, make sure to heal your main character often, even if you think he doesn't need it. 1HP makes all the difference. This forces you to strategize.

Enemies appear in the field in semi-real-time, semi-random way...enemies can materialize anywhere they want, but you still have to run into them before battle is initiated.

Dungeons can be mazes, or large open rooms...you have to destroy urns and use magic circles to open gates, thus, dungeons tend not to be linear, a rather good move on the part of the developer.

PROS -  The background music is awesome.  The animation sequences of the characters is quite good (great transition between scenarios). The characters voices & dialoque are very effective to the story being told. The games storyline is true to the author.  You can SAVE OFTEN (and you must!!!!).
CONS -  LONG & FREQUENT Game BOOT (loading) between scenarios.  NO Middle Earth Maps to be used.  NO mapping or auto mapping features (as in MORROWIND) (you must memorize quickly or die).  This means NO REFERENCING for location.  NO GOING BACK or EXPLORING.  Limited Inventory features.  THIS IS ONLY A CONTINUOUS SLASH/GASH GAME.  You only play FRODO, STRIDER & GANDALF at specific check points (NO OPTIONS). (for example; Frodo from start to BREE. STRIDER from BREE to RIVENDELL etc. no other choices)  LIMITED path advance (NO ROAMING as in MORROWIND).  ONLY FRODO USES STEALTH.  STRIDER & GANDALF MUST FIGHT or RUN or be KILL by EVERYONE (this is NON-STOP).  Almost everything is resolved by killing, destroying or dying. (again only FRODO can use stealth). You must move quickly or die!! You must CONSTANTLY search for food, health & magic potions (this distracts the game player from reaching specific scenario goals).

It was 5% story, 5% puzzles, & 90% hidden object game (HOG) which is why I guess they call it HOG! I've only played a couple of HOG, this didn't seem that hard just tedious. Game pretty simple in puzzles. If you're a causal HOG, you'll probably like this. If you're a hardcore HOG, who knows? Nicely done graphics for a HOG. Creepy atmosphere on ship.

Durham,"Sega's Super Monkey Ball series has always been one of those kind of franchises that offer simplistic fun, but what's made the series so memorable has always been it's unique charm and presentation.  The series makes it's debut on the DS with Super Monkey Ball: Touch & Roll; and while it offers much of what fans would expect from the series, there's nothing here you haven't seen before, and haven't seen done better either.  Featuring 100 stages and the tried but true rolling monkey in a ball gameplay, Touch & Roll also offers some touch screen controls (hence the title) for the main game mode that are incredibly awkward to say the least.  The various mini-games, which there aren't nearly enough of, are where the real fun of Touch & Roll is to be had, but there's nothing here that you can't find on any of the console versions of the series, or even the older GBA title, which is actually better than this DS edition.  That being said, Super Monkey Ball: Touch & Roll is definitely worth checking out for DS owners or fans of the franchise craving some portable monkey action, but don't expect anything relatively new here.",Don't touch the monkeys!!!,1178582400,4,,

For a, well, 'not SOCOM' game it actually stacks up pretty well.  The graphics are okay, not outstanding, so probably a 7/10 rating.  The game can get a little choppy at times as well, but it usually doesn't effect gameplay.  The first player mode isn't too great, getting hit hard by the lack of difficulty throughout the missions.  Even if you chose the toughest mode, elite, the levels still don't seem to be that hard.  Even though there are about 30 missions, you can finish the game in a few days easy.  HOWEVER!!! The multiplayer is EXCELLENT.  No one mentions this in reviews!!  And I don't mean online because that isn't incredible but still fun, but I mean the split screen so you can play at home with friends.  All of the top games, Splinter Cell PT, SOCOM, etc... don't have split screen at all or it isn't that great.  You have 31 levels to chose from and 10 modes, and you can be 1 of 4 types of players (Sniper, Demolitions, Riflesmen, and Support).  With all of these combinations, the multiplayer is extremely fun and is the only reason why I'd by this game.  There aren't a lot of new games that have great split screen action for the FPS games, but this is definitely a step in the right direction.

The Bad: Gun play gets repetitive after awhile, can be tough in spots, driving isn't any fun, a little on the short side

Even after 2 years Alan Wake is still an excellent game. With updated visuals for PC, and the inclusion of both DLC, the PC version is worth the buy. Even 360 players should come back for another shot just to see the sweet new looks. Alan Wake was my favorite story of 2010 and is still great today. You play as Alan Wake, a famous New York author who takes a vacation to the Northwest in Bright Falls. He ends up renting a cabin, and before you know it his wife jumps into the lake. He then wakes up from a car accident and so your adventure begins. I can't give away anything except he is writing what is happening to him. The story is very novel like and has a great pace. The narrative is delivered with likeable characters and great voice acting.

You walk around collecting manuscript pages that will tell you kind of what's going to happen in the next scene. You can also find coffee thermoses as collectibles, but I wonder why thermoses? Is this a jab at the hot coffee mod for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, or a little sign that the guys at Remedy were up long nights trying to complete this? Who knows, but it is an interesting thing. There is also a strange phone barcode tag that has a strange stab at Max Payne. I think back when Alan Wake was released it was a hint at Max Payne 3.

The whole game is wrapped around light and dark gameplay, literally. You use your flashlight to burn away darkness from The Taken and then shoot them until they disappear. The gunplay is challenging and can be fun. There are various tools for burning away darkness like the flare gun, which does major area damage, flashbangs, and flares give you distance from enemies. You can also get bigger flashlights later on which burn away darkness faster. Most enemies will throw weapons at you or attack you directly with scythes, axes, and bats. The whole game is set in the countryside so The Taken look like farmers, sheriffs, loggers, and various other occupations in those areas. The Taken are pretty creepy because they spurt out lines about their occupation in mixed normal talk and deep creepy voices.

There are some environmental light sources you can use like giant spotlights, and some smaller ones to help you fight the darkness. The combat overall is fun and challenging, but never changes which means repetition sets in quickly. Thankfully the game is paced nicely so you aren't constantly fighting. A lot of the time you are running from the darkness and it can possess objects and throw them at you. Of course you have to burn it away so that stops. Large vehicles like tractors, bulldozers, and trucks act as bosses. A lot of the fighting is also broken up with cut scenes and in-game dialog.

This is pretty much all there is to it except the lame attempts at puzzles. There are a few spread out, but they really aren't puzzles at all. I think the game could have used some better ones, but what is here works well enough. There are some fun set pieces that are memorable, but there is one issue I don't understand. Why do survival horrors have crappy driving mechanics? First it was Alone in the Dark, then Deadly Premonition, and now Alan Wake. The cars drive like you're on ice, and despite boosting the lights to run Taken over, they damage the car real quick.

Anyways, the game looks gorgeous with nice DirectX 10 effects that are actually noticeable. The lighting is better, the effects are better, and the higher resolution textures are a sight for sore eyes. The Xbox 360 version, even when it was released, didn't look too hot with blurry textures which made it look ugly in spots. If you have the rig to run this game you are in for a visual treat. The nice effects like lens flare from the flares that blind your vision, and overall lighting effects look fantastic here.

Overall, for the $30 Alan Wake is a steal for PC gamers and a nice price for 360 owners so maybe traded in their game long ago and want another go. This game is memorable and so is the story. This is a game you will talk about amongst friends.

Half-Life was brilliant. It revolutionized the first person shooter, provided hours of entertainment, introduced us to a world of weapons and bizarre creatures, and most importantly- it (unlike most video games) stayed with its plot throughout the game. Then Opposing Force came along- a mission pack that was a game in and of itself, the player now switching sides and playing through the Military (one of the enemies in the original Half-Life). Although less plot-driven than the original (its cheif weakness) it still managed to create a very good gaming atmosphere, even if it didn't quite match up with the first. Then Blue Shift came along.

I (although a huge fan of the first two) was apprehensive; I felt Sierra was trying to capitalize upon the success of the first two and, running out of ideas, was stretching things thin by having the player play as a security guard...Barney Calhoun. I was mistaken- The game is faithful to the first (with none of the weapons from OP4, but most from the original) and adds in some new things....people, locations, plotlines. It was most enjoyable to navigate Barney Calhoun through the waterworks and train depots of the Black Mesa compound, and the ending was significantly different than that of the first two.......I was very impressed by its simplicity and practicality.  The game takes everything that was good about the original and compresses it into a smaller package, but also adds several new sights and locations that lend much to the backstory of Half-Life and show even more of the breadth of the Black Mesa compound, things that I appreciated very much.

Hold onto your hats.
----
I should start off by saying that this controller's drivers are plug-n'-play, and when they are installed, you can use XPadder or Joy2Key to map the buttons to keyboard keys. Otherwise, you can map the buttons to your favorite emulator's input.
----
This controller is based off of the controller that the Famicom (Japanese NES) had, as opposed to the NES. An important thing to remember is that the Player 1 controller for the Famicom had all the same buttons as the NES, this controller just has extra buttons.
The extra buttons are for playing SNES games, as the extra buttons on the right are X and Y, and some shoulder buttons are hiding on the top. Above the Start & Select buttons are Turbo and Clear; buttons that let you use a turbo function with any button combination. Just hold the buttons you want to rapid-fire, press ""Turbo,"" and that's it. Press those buttons again, and they'll be firing rapidly in-game! Hold the same buttons and press ""Clear,"" to reset this.
Aside from the extra buttons, the rest of the buttons are amazing. You might notice that on most other NES USB controllers, the D-Pad is absolutely terrible. On this controller, the money is worth it, as the controller is made in Japan, and the D-Pad and buttons are EXCELLENT! Great responsiveness on every button, and the D-Pad handles diagonal directions like a pro.
The Start and Select buttons are made of rubber, too, if that tickles your fancy.
------
So why would I only give this a 4/5?
To put it simply, I do not like the gold sticker.
On the Famicom, the gold area shown in the controller's picture was actually a sheet of metal, but on this, it's a sticker. Immediately, I am questioning how long it will take for my fingers to wear away the sticker around the buttons. I could always have another sticker printed, but I prefer a controller I don't have to maintain. To be fair, the metal sheet presents this problem as well, but this is a longer process.
Alongside this, the letters above the two added buttons should be swapped, in my opinion. this way, the controller's buttons would look like the 4 SNES buttons turned to the side. This is a minor gripe, however, as you can map any button to whatever you want as soon as the drivers are installed.
------
To summarize, this is a nearly perfect controller that is perfect for emulating games for NES, Gameboy to GBA, SNES, and even Sega Genesis or others! I highly recommend this controller for anyone who's tired of using a keyboard with their emulators.
------------
EDIT: After about 7 months of use, I must say that the D-Pad on this thing feels a little looser than it did when I first bought it. Now it's far too easy to accidentally press up when playing a sidescroller, and that's no good for games like Castlevania and Shovel Knight.

The first thing you'll notice is that, finally, SNK has changed up the menu screen, and added goals to each of the 16 games that when completed will unlock new features and extras.  Featured here in this collection are titles found on previous home console collections like the first installments of Art of Fighting, World Heroes, Metal Slug, and Fatal Fury; but there are some real gems to be found here as well.  Baseball Stars 2, King of the Monsters, King of Fighters '94, Samurai Shodown, Last Resort, Top Hunter, and Shock Troopers are all wonderful experiences that make this compilation worth picking up alone.  Some games aren't all that special, like Burning Fight, while others are decent enough like Super Sidekicks 3 and Sengoku.  That being said, you won't find any bad games in this collection, but what really hurts it are some technical issues.  Shock Troopers and King of the Monsters specifically suffer from some very noticable slowdown, while Art of Fighting, Fatal Fury, World Heroes, and Sengoku feature archaic controls that show the age of the games.  Flaws aside though, you can't beat what you get with SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1: 16 games ranging from decent to great, and a nice list of unlockables.  However, the fact that the game doesn't carry the kind of ultra-budget price tag on the PSP that it does on the PS2 is a little mind boggling, but all things considered, this is still a great compilation.

The original base game was designed to be far larger than anyone's willingness to be compulsively complete, and now, as an additional lure, two new pieces have been tacked on.  Making the story frightening in scope.
You start out as a memory-less waif shipped to Vvardenfell by the Emperor, and gradually become the most powerful man, woman, elf, lizard or whatever on the continent.  You get to lie, cheat, steal, and above all, fight for hundreds of hours.  Morrowind isn't an RPG, it's a lifetime hobby.  Unless, of course, you can figure out a way to make yourself stop.  In my case it took 400 hours of play and the death of anything that even closely resembled a god before I shook free.
This is a classic Elder Scrolls game in terms of delivery.  Animation, graphics and design are a notch better than average, but they fall well short of what the Xbox is capable of.  In fact, unless my memory fails me, Ultima IX was actually was slightly better from an art viewpoint - and that was nearly 10 years ago.  Morrowind has the same, slightly retro feel to it.  This isn't bad, but the imaginative architecture and paraphernalia cry out for more details.
Size has both positive and negative aspects, though.  Travel rapidly becomes time consuming, and it is only slowly that you will get this under control.  There is a limited selection of enemies as well.  If I have to kill one more Cliff Racer I am going to exterminate the species.  Take my advice, don't try to play the entire game through.  Pick a faction quest, wander arounds, and only nibble at the main story line.  Be very careful about where you put things, you may need them later.  And take frequent breaks.
I was much relieved to see other reviewers mention the fact that the game hangs up frequently - I was worried that my brand new Xbox was having a terminal problem.  Take this warning seriously.  Save often and compulsively.  It is too easy to get caught up in a difficult passage and let saving slide.  And there is nothing like the howl of frustration that comes from having hours of effort go straight into digital catalepsy.

I'm an avid Halo and CoD player, it was just recently (when my internet finally upgraded) that I was able to experience this game to it's full potential, and it by far exceeds my previous empression when it first came out. It was also just recently that I got to really try out a DICE multiplayer, and honestly I'm finding myself more and more engulfed in it's gameplay and overall feel... which for me to say feels actually weird.

I mostly spend time on the squad death match, and in this area it really depends on what type of players your playing with and against. If your a sniper, there's a plethora of sniping spots with incredible lines of sight, and if you a run and gun... there's series of building's to traverse as your making your way across the map. If your a Run and Gun type of person such as I am, you won't have much luck moving around certain maps as highly skilled players with a 'particular sniper' will basically dominate the game. Although these players are hard to come across, and you may not find them a problem if you do, but be warned.

DLC: Get the Weapon Time Saver Pack (unlocks ALL weapon unlocks for MP) if you want to invest your time beefing up your K/D ratio, as it does take a fair amount of time to upgrade your weapons otherwise. And especially do this if your into sniping, as it unlocks a holy of holy of sniping guns.

New objects, new venues, new traits and skills, and new careers  all of them themed around this island and boating lifestyle. But the real attraction here is the addition of houseboats and the opportunity to build and manage your very own resort.

No longer is your Sim restricted to the ground beneath his/her feet. Houseboats are exactly what they sound like, your Sims' house on a boat, giving you the ability to go anywhere in the ocean. Aesthetically and functionally, it's just like any other house you'd build. Aside from the nautical themed decorations and All-in-one bathroom, there's not much different. You still have all your basic rooms and can perform all the same actions you'd do in a regular house (even going to work by way of water taxi). Being in the ocean is in no way limiting, but it's also not as rewarding as I'd like.

Gameplay when owning a houseboat does open up a bit. You can travel from dock to dock and travel the local islands, or you can take your houseboat (or ski boat or Jet Ski) for a whirl and unlock uncharted territories and open up new areas for you to drop anchor and discover. Underwater explorations through the scuba diving and snorkeling activities can lead to the discovery of exotic fish, caves, and shipwrecks. Like everything else you do, these activities serve as a nice break from the monotony of every day Sim life. It's worth noting, that to take part in some of these activities you need to increase your Sim's scuba diving skill.

But for as neat as owning a houseboat and swimming underwater can be, that alone isn't the attraction of Island Paradise. The notion of building and running your own resort was the highlight, mostly because it adds a new element to The Sims 3 gameplay. Resorts in Island Paradise don't follow the typical build-and-play routine. You can actually manage the resort, making all the decisions from what amenities you offer to the uniforms of your employees.

Owning your own resort can be a bit overwhelming, but it gives you something to strive for. Whether your building a resort from scratch or purchasing an existing one, it's up to you to get it the best rating possible  decided by guest reactions to the amenities, food, environment, and a ton of other factors. there are a lot of extras in the limited edition that makes it worth getting.",Prepare to run a resort that the sims want to come to,1373414400,2,{'Platform:': ' PC/Mac'},

Tim Schafer is a mad man. Let's just get that out in the open. He has a sick, twisted mind and lives in a more cartoony version of any of Tim Burton's films. This mind is perfect for writing video game masterpieces. When you experience a Schafter game, you are generally felt with a bondship between the characters you encounter and yourself.

Brtal Legend is no different. As the game starts off, you generally want to care for the characters, hoping that this journey won't end in failure. But what really grabs you is not only the characters, but this twisted land of metal that Schafer has pulled out from the imagination of metal legends and their legendary album covers. If you really go back and look at a metal cover by bands like 'Iron Maiden' or 'Slayer', you see these horrible images of death and destruction: perfect for video games! And this is what Tim managed to accomplish by combining humor and colorfulness to the very dark and violent images you see in metal.

Enough of the overall conceptual background. The story is pure magic. You star as Eddie Riggs, a roadie that tours with a rapcore ""metal"" band of today's world known as Kabbage Boy, and manages to get smashed by his own evil stage creation. Through this, and his magic belt (which is Ormagden, an ancient ruler of the metal land), he manages to travel back in time, to when metal was king. A time before the 70s and 80s. With the help of a few true metal warriors, you battle in the Ancient World for peace against Doviculus, the Emperor of the Tainted Coil, and his Glam metal minions. While the game is an overall short experience (around 7-10 hours), you will end up having a blast the time you are playing.

The game plays out like a typcial hack and slash. You have your battle axes for melee combat and electric guitars for ranged attack. You're also equipted with a car, a hot rod, that can be upgraded to be a mean machine with a killer engine, as well as guns and mines. If these do not excite you, you also have the ability to double team with any friendly AI unit on your team, as well as beast of the field. For instance, your first group of allied AI is the Headbangers. When you jump into their group, or double team with them, you are in a sort of mosh pit that knocks anyone around in a more controlled melee beating, as well as giving them more damage. You can do the same thing with player vehicles, giving you alternative methods to use your allies.

The point of the game is to reclaim the land by completing several quest. The main quest is generally the same thing. You battle bosses, drive and protect a tricked-out tour bus from baddies, and then basically play a somewhat strategy game of ""Defend the Stage, Attack the Stage"". The way this is set up, your crew builds a stage and you have to control your merchandise stands, all of which are built on fans that generate into your economy. You'll have to keep a balance between fighting off the opposing stage and enemies, while maintaining your troops and your own stage. Really, this is a difficult thing to accomplish, especially if you're looking at it like you're playing an RTS game rather than an action hack and slash game. This almost seem overwhelming the first few battles, and when you finally get the hang of it, they bust out the Tainted Coil teams which felt are a lot like the Zergs in StarCraft. They'll rush and crush you. Giving that this is the main point of the single player experience, and multi player, you better get used to playing in a mode like this.

Some of the side quest are really great, but they do tend to be on the repetitive side. You basically have the choice to defend or ambush enemies, race a wise-talking Irish demon, help a cannonier learn how to use his cannon, hunt wild animals, or just find hidden treasures. Basically, you'll do these a lot, over and over. Granted, they're side quest, so if you don't want to do them, you don't have to. They're more of added bonuses.

Multi player is something that can be either extremely fun and exciting or make you want to duck and run. It follows the same method as the single player's stage battles, but some of the players you'll encounter seem to have been born playing this game already. A general hint to beating these foes is to just remember the game is not an RTS, no matter how much it looks like it.

As for graphics, for being a new engine, it looks great. It fits into Tim's overall world and is set apart from other worlds. It does everything, from great facial animations to terrific lighting, very well. While it looks great, you will encounter some minor hickups during the game, mainly in the overworld. The sounds are terrific, and with a 100+ soundtrack, you can't go wrong.

First question I thought to myself was does it still hold up pretty well? Well yes it does actually. The game is obviously dated visual wise since its more than a decade old now. It doesn't bother me though given that it's from the generation that I started gaming from. Though I was pretty surprised at how good it looks for an old school FPS. The dinosaurs look and move around beautifully. The humanoid enemies you fight actually have faces (which was a pretty big deal back then) and you can see them shoulder their weapons and fire back at you. While the levels are pretty linear they look good and you aren't given illusions of ""freedom"" like in other games. Everything you see you can pretty much get to, nothing is slapped on to make it look pretty.

The game-play is pretty straightforward. Go from point A to point B while collecting some keys to unlock the next level. You collect a 100 tokens to earn lives and pick up med kits to restore health lost from battling enemies. Every now and then you come across platform challenges for extra tokens or to get a new weapon to get a better edge. Surprisingly these platform bits weren't as difficult as I'd thought. I was pretty intimidated by the three limb N-64 controller when I looked at it for the first time in years, wondering how I even managed. It actually controls alright, though it does feel somewhat awkward at times.

If there is something that Turok has that newer FPS games don't have is novelty. It reeks old school FPS given that you fight dinosaurs and use large bulky Sci-Fi weapons that turn enemies to mulch. You battle bosses like a large insect that spits acid and T-Rex. I kind of miss this. FPS games that didn't take themselves too seriously. When you fought dinosaurs and super soldiers instead of endlessly re-spawning Russians. When you carried an armory on your back and not just two guns. Health bars and the like. While the story (if it even has one) may be stupid, is it any dumber than a scenario when the US is invaded by all of South America for no apparent reason?

Its worth a play through and I'd recommend it. If you have a cartridge you should hold onto it because the chances of it being re-released for any consoles seem pretty low.","WARNING, Some nostalgia bias ahead",1391472000,3,,

The game should be familiar to anyone who has played the original Disgaea, but as a refresher for those who haven't: Disgaea is a turn-based tactical role playing game. Using a grid system, characters move, attack, and use special abilities. The RPG element comes in as characters improve through battling, compared to the disposable soldiers of many RTS games. There are, furthermore, many classes to choose from, including warriors, mages, and thieves. This is a system seen in games like Tactics Ogre, Final Fantasy Tactics, and many others.

For its part, Disgaea brings a lot of elements that are unique to it and its sequel. For example, the RPG system includes not only the effects on the character's leveling up, but also a teacher/student system that grants abilities to other characters. Geo Symbols, another feature of Disgaea's combat, are colored pyramids that, when put on certain location types, can give off various effects to connected areas. The ability to lift and throw characters, either as an offensive attack or to give allies a boost in a certain direction, is also present. Units with similar types can use team-up attacks that boost their power when they're near each other.

In Disgaea, you take the role of Laharl, the Prince of the Underworld. After being awoken from a 2-year nap, Laharl finds that his father, the King, has passed away, and in his absence the underworld has been rife with conflict over who the next overlord will be. With his faithful vassal Etna in tow, Laharl seeks to regain control of his empire. The story and dialogue are rife with comedy - unusually clumsy assassins, parodies of the Power Rangers and Flash Gordon, and the general apathy that Laharl's underlings display toward him. The writing is excellent, and the PSP edition allows you to use both the English and Japanese voice acting.

The graphics have been well maintained in the transition to the small screen. They actually seem to fit better on the PSP, without as many obvious pixels and edges. Both the graphics and the sound are unchanged from the PS2 version, the only new features being the aforementioned dual language audio choice and a new music changing option.

As a whole, Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness is a good port of a solid game. It doesn't change much, but there wasn't much that needed to be changed. If you've played the game before, though, it's not exactly worth buying again.

So I bought a second controller and sure enough, this comes with enough pads for two controllers!  First off, if you already have a controller with broken thumbpads, I do not recommend these.  The width of these assumes you have the original thumbpad on it already and I can attest that with the new controller, these work just fine.  However, if you have a broken one (I.E. the original rubber is chewed up), these work poorly with the chewed up rubber.  Your best bet is to tear the broken rubber off and make a spacer to bridge the original rubber gap that these are assuming are already there.  If you don't have a spacer, these move around a lot.  So, TLDR - if you are thinking ahead and get these to protect your existing non broken rubber grips - do it, great buy.

You've perhaps fought as a Jedi, or a Fighter Pilot, but Battlefront takes you to the trenches of the galactic struggle of the Republic vs. the Empire or the Rebellion vs. the Empire on all sides of the conflict.

In the Clone Wars, you can fight as a member of the Clone army as a foot soldier, marksman, artillery trooper or commando.  Each station has it's own choice of weaponry specific to the character.  Or you can choose to fight as a droid.  The droid option offers the player the expanded choice of experiencing game play as not only a foot soldier, but also as a super battle droid or Droideka. (For proper names and a complete listing of options, consult Wookieepedia).

Additionally, the player is given the option of fighting in the Civil War of the first three films either on the side of the Rebellion or the empire.  You can fight as a Rebel Pilot, foot soldier, vanguard (the guys with the big white helmets) an artillery gunner or a marksman.  If you fight for the empire, you can fight as a stormtrooper, Scout trooper, demolitions trooper, AT-ST pilot, and more.  Each with its own unique set of weapons and skills.

There are numerous theaters from Tatooine to Naboo to Hoth.  Each planet offers it's own unique terrain and obstacles.  There are also a number of vehicles and weapons that the player can commandeer, however as of this writing I have not figured out how to do so.

There are also appearances by the luminaries of the Jedi order and Sith.  Darth Vader, Mace Windu, and Luke Skywalker all appear in the game...usually just before the player is killed in my humble experience.

The graphics are amazingly crisp and detailed, and the movement of the players is realistic.  The weapons and buildings are superb!

The only complaint I have is that upon restarting the game after being killed, the player starts where the game began, often a fair distance from the battle itself.  The travel time to the battle is often tedious for those seeking to get right back to the fight.  In some instances my avatar has been sprinting toward the fight only to find that my side has either won or been defeated before I could get there.

All in all, this is an enjoyable and challenging game.  However, there seems to be no means by which to store your progress so that you can return to the game at a later time.  During the individual campaigns you can go back to where you left off, but I've not yet found a way to return to an abandoned game when I come back.

Still, it's a great take on the Star Wars Universe and games and allows for a variety of action.  Great play value.","On the front lines with the Galaxies Finest Figthing men, women, Clones, Wookies, and robots.",1294876800,7,,
241042,4.0,True,"10 6, 2012",A1IO9Z72JRBTXB,B0050SXLQC,Dock Saint,"Resident Evil 6 is not a survival horror game. Period. It's a top notch third-person shooter involving zombies, monsters, and biological weapons. The only reason I did not give this game five stars is because no matter how hard I try I cannot help but feel a little disappointed that it's nothing like the previous ones. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, it's just my own personal opinion.

  If you're reading this, then chances are you've already read much longer reviews outlining the pros and cons, the new innovations, and the gameplay mechanics. The only reason I'm writing this is so anyone who's still on the fence about buying this game can get a simple, calm review. A lot of reviews (good and bad) are so heated on this game that it's hard for me to read more than one or two at a time.

  What eventually drove me to write this is going back and reading reviews of RE1 and 2. The complaints for those games are:
1. The camera
2. The aiming
3. The pacing (too slow)
4. The controls (move like a tank)
5. The ""stupid"" puzzles
6. Not enough ammo
7. Can't move and shoot

  Now the complaints for RE6:

1. The camera
2. The aiming
3. The pacing (too fast)
4. The controls (move like an action hero)
5. The lack of puzzles
6. Too much ammo
7. Moving and shooting is lame
8. Zombies body parts fall off and can't shoot them in the same area anymore (someone actually complained about this)

  I'll be the first to admit, RE6 is lacking big time as far as the ""throw back"" factor is concerned. However, I appreciate what they're doing here. I personally love the whole lay-on-your-back-and-frantically-shoot-enemies feature. I also like that I can actually melee instead of swipe the air in front of me with a knife hoping to make contact. I agree that having to wait for the zombies to move before I can shoot them is lame, and I had a bit of a struggle adapting to the assault rifle zombie (though he really just holds down the trigger in sporadic bursts that go all over, mostly hitting the ground). The J'Avo are NOT zombies. They are bio-weapons, superhumans if you will. They sometimes transform into other creatures. This I can accept. I had to adapt to RE6's gameplay. I do things like turn on a high difficulty and pace myself. Do I HAVE to walk down that hall with my gun drawn? Well, no. But I do because that creates more tension and I can take in the atmosphere more.

  I was skeptical at first about Wesker's son Jake. It seemed pretty cliche and silly to me. Then I remembered that the entire story of all of them is. Again, this is not to say I don't like all the others, I love them. But honestly, the dialogue and voice acting has always been pretty bad. That's just one of the things that I fell in love with back then (along with tank controls!). Jake's story even has a Nemsis theme throughout, but that still isn't enough for some folks. Also, by the time I got to the second chapter of Leon's campaign (three hours in) there was some extensive puzzle solving. However, they do baby you through them via pop ups and quest markers. My solution? Turn off the HUD. It clears the screen up and makes the game more approachable. I don't feel like I shouldn't have to do that, rather I appreciate the option to do so.

  It's things like these that I think offend some old school RE fans. I downloaded all of the previous ones a few months ago, and even got Archives for Wii. Those games are great, but they're not RE6. I guarantee the last time 90% of the people complaining about the new gameplay mechanics played RE1, 2, or 3 was at least 3 years ago when they got upset about RE5, if not longer. The point I'm trying to make to you, the potential buyer, is that Resident Evil has changed. Not for better, not for worse. It's just different. If you're hoping for a survival horror experience, it won't be found here. If you're expecting an RE revival, forget about it. But if you're interested in a quality, A-list third-person game with some horror elements, a lot of gore, and a plethora of fight-for-your-life situations (which typically involve ACTION, regardless of the game) then go pick up a copy. If nothing else at least rent it, and draw your own conclusions. Like I said in my Dead Island review, if you're this far into researching it, you're probably going to get it anyways.

I like the strategy of taking a group of settlers and making multiple cities that you defend and grow in order to become victorious over your opponents (real or computer).  It is great fun to try different things in order to achieve a different type of victory.

I believe many of the reviewers of this game are giving low marks because they are mostly comparing this to real-time strategy games for PC like Age Of Empires, Command & Conquer, and Starcraft.  In my opinion even though these games have a similar goal, they are very different in the way they are played.  When I see ""turn based strategy"" vs. ""real-time strategy"" I am able to make that distinction and review accordingly.

There is nothing wrong with a turn-based approach and it works well on the PS3 for this game.  Real-time strategy games will still rule on the PC, but at least for console users of the PS3 this is a really fun strategy game based on building a culture and dominating your opponents in one of many types of victories.

This is another logical extension to BL2, just like BL2 was an extension to the original Borderlands.  Similar dynamics as the other games, almost the same operational experience as BL2 (weapons, mods, stores, skins, etc).  There are some new items, like laser guns, oxygen packs, etc, but the gun generators are basically the same, as are the shields, ammo, etc.

If there is a weakness, its in the writing....  I don't exactly play video games to increase my social consciousness or my IQ, I play for fun and entertainment.  The first 2 Borderlands installments were funny, witty, riddled with absurd 1 liners, inside jokes, useless quests, and basically ridiculous characters.  This one though, seems to be lacking the sharp writing, the witty passages, the insane 1 liners.  There are plenty of new characters, but only 1 or 2 are memorable, while the NPCs/enemies are fairly bland.

Looks like Anthony Burch is back as one of the writers, but maybe the other writers aren't as crazy as the writers on the first 2 games.  Or maybe direction is lacking, etc, etc.... I have no idea, nor am I an expert.  But as a lover of Borderlands, this one is not as engaging as the others, but that doesn't make it a bad game at all.  Its still Borderlands, its still great, its still super fun, and its still a great game to lose yourself in.

All in all, I loved this game, just a tad less than the others.  I played it through every mission, side mission, killed the final boss twice, etc, and will definitely play it again.  I'll likely play again when the DLC start coming out, as they always do.

Real sunshine!) to do it.  Game environments even alter themselves depending on whether it is day or night.  Perfect.

In fact, limited sun-power during nighttime gameplay actually necessitates it.
It's true that this a new way of playing.  Still, sometimes the gameplay and puzzles are a little dull and repetitive--which is heartbreakingly disappointing given the attention paid to all other aspects of game design.  Boktai is conceptually thrilling, but the actual game is just sort of... not.  Gameplay simply isn't quite what it should have been.

The controls and game style are a lot like Metal Gear Solid 2 (as you can probably tell from numerous other reviewers), so if you go from that game to this one (as I did) you'll be catching on rather quickly.  The only thing that really stinks about this game is the saving system.  You can save at any point during a level, but if you get killed you're starting all over again on that level.  In other words, if you have 8 objectives on a level (find this, move that, etc) and get 7 of them done but get killed, then you start all over again.  This makes the game unnecessarily repetitious and takes away from the overall fun of the game rather quickly.  Likewise, if you begin a new level, you have to figure out if you have time to completely finish it or not.  Otherwise, it doesn't make sense to start a mission you'll just have to start all over again if you don't get through at that moment.

I've put my thoughts below on each aspect of the game.

STORY
GTA V takes place in a fictional Southern California with some bits of Nevada thrown in to round things out. You experience the story from the perspective of 3 central characters: 1) Michael, the retired bank-robber being pulled back into his old life, 2) Franklin, the street hustler who's got dreams of moving up into the big-time, 3) Trevor, the sociopath drug-dealing best friend of Michael from his bank-robbing days. The general story takes place with the 3 characters all being brought together by bigger events that keep adding up as you play the game. The execution of how the characters are portrayed feels accurate, and its fun getting to have such different mission types between the 3 characters. There is now the option to retry missions and try things out differently next time too with gold rankings to shoot for in each. And don't worry about getting frustrated over some levels which have annoying sequences that you just can't get past - fail a part of a mission 3 times and you get the option to skip it. While the storyline itself was sound in terms of game design, I felt that it frankly wasn't a very original story and at times to me felt predictable and cliche. This goes back to my main point that the best part of GTA V isn't the campaign story, it's everything else it's got to offer.

GAMEPLAY
The dynamic switching between the 3 characters really adds a new layer of immersion and variety to the gameplay. Each character starts out with their own skillset, and kind of like Skyrim the more you perform any given activity the better you'll get at it. You drive more to improve your character's driving ability, take flying lessons to get better at flying, run/bike/swim more to build up your stamina, etc. It feels like a very natural process and kind of gives the player goals to work towards as you play the game. The shooting mechanic by default comes with a very generous auto-aim, that makes the game almost too easy in terms of combat, though you can change this. There is a great variety of weapons this time around, with plenty of customization and a shooting range to try them out on.

Driving in terms of technical game design is built fine. The main issue comes from the cars that you have available to use. In fact there are only a handful of cars I even bother looking for to drive because the rest handle so poorly. Part of that I get is by design, since a prius isn't going to handle corners like a dodge viper. Still, I can't help but feel like a lot of the cars I expected to be great to drive felt like a mess on the road (I'm talking about cars like the Diablo aka. Lambo rip-off). I even maxed out my driving skill to make sure it wasn't something missing on my end, but my experience with the cars has been a unfortunate mixed bag. I am very happy with the few cars I did think handle well, and upgraded them immediately and haven't had many issues since then. I personally absolutely hated flying other vehicles like helicopters and especially planes, but I didn't really spend much time practicing flying either.

Special abilities for each character keep things fresh, with Franklin getting a mode where he can slow things down while driving and make precision maneuvers, Trevor getting a rage mode where he can take more and dish out more damage, and Michael getting his own combat boost too. All in all, the gameplay is sound mechanically though it doesn't exactly do much to stand out aside from the special abilities either (which you could argue are borrowed from previous games like Max Payne and others).

SIDE MISSIONS/RANDOM EVENTS
This was by far one of the more engaging parts of the game for me, mostly because of how ridiculous some of they are. Side missions range from the standard stuff like assassinations and street races to new ones like bounty hunting, Trevor's ""rage"" missions, stealing celebrities clothing, to paparazzi stalking. Side missions are often unique to specific characters, and encourages you to try out and advance each character through each one. I frankly loved them because of just how ridiculous they were and how different they are from the standard stuff you've seen in previous open-world games including previous GTA games. The dialogue and banter on these kinds of missions is just great, and really adds a lot to flesh out the game and make it more immersive. There are also random characters you can encounter that give you some of these side activities and missions (again, specific to each character) and there are also random events that happen like robberies or car thefts that you can choose to intervene in or not. This is very similar to what Rockstar did in Red Dead Redemption with random strangers asking you for help on the road-side that you can choose to help or ignore. You can even stop a thief and keep the stolen money for yourself if you want.

HEISTS
The big heists are what are always shown off in the game trailers, and they are definitely plenty of fun because of the planning you have to do before you can pull it off. You get to do everything from picking your crew, opting for the more qualified but higher cost members or going for the cheaper ones of questionable quality. Even how you set-up the heist matters, and will give you different results/rewards based on how well you pull things off. It gives you a great reason to go back and try things differently with a replay, and frankly makes it feel like a more authentic experience similar to most crime movies. The great set-piece moments keep things fun, though like most things they lose a bit of their luster after you've seen it the first few times. I love the fact that you can switch around between the characters on the heists, and see things from a different perspective and always get to try out the really cool parts of each heist that each character gets to do. Not much else I can say about the heists beyond this, since I want to keep this fairly spoiler free.

IMMERSION/THE WORLD OF GTA
Rockstar did a fantastic job recreating Los Angeles, speaking as someone living in LA right now. All the big recognizable landmark locations are there, from the Griffith Observatory to the Promenade and the Hollywood sign. When I say they have it down, I mean I was able to literally walk to the exact area where I took a picture at the observatory overlooking downtown, down to the staircase and pillars. They did their homework, and it absolutely shows in several parts of the game. There are lots of activities to do including shopping, tennis (one of my favorites), yoga, golf, hunting, marathons, mountain biking, flying, shooting, etc. There's plenty to keep you entertained for a while, and that's not counting other things like playing the stocks or buying up real-estate. I love how tied together the world is, and it feels like you're living in a continuously moving world that's reacting to your actions. For example, if you lets say go out of your way to deface/devalue a company and buy up stock in their competitor you can catch the news to see stock prices jump around and reap the rewards. Even just switching between the characters shows them going on living their lives when you're not controlling them. Trevor was driving around still in a semi-truck from a mission that he was in when I was playing as Michael.

It's the little details like that which go a long way to making you feel like Los Santos is a living breathing world. Even just taking a walk around town and overhearing strangers can give you a good laugh, not to mention going in to see a shrink. It's because of how great a job Rockstar does with the little things that it makes it all the more apparent when they do drop the ball. There are a lot of buildings you can't go into, and plenty you cannot interact with. I went down to the Santa Monica pier and couldn't go into the main restaurants there, or go into many restaurants anywhere really. This isn't like Skyrim where nearly every person you run across has a story to tell. What GTA does offer is great, it's just a shame that after 5 years in development there's not more of it. The world size itself is huge, though to be fair the actual city part of it isn't exactly huge and sprawling. I appreciate all the wilderness and desert terrain since it adds some diversity in my opinion, but some people might find it boring.

GRAPHICS AND SOUND
The graphics are absolutely a solid step above GTA IV. But honestly compared to other games out today this isn't anything to write home about. I found the facial animations for anyone outside of the main characters to be very lacking in cutscenes and gameplay alike. But I understand that concessions have to be made to run such a huge open world without load times (except for the really long one when you first start it up). It's not an ugly game by any means, and there's a lot of great looking parts to it. It runs incredibly smoothly on what is now pretty old hardware for the consoles, and that's a great achievement. Rockstar clearly put in some serious time for optimization on the framerate front and it is much appreciated. It helps keep things rolling even in high action scenes unlike many other open-world games that start to chug.

The sound design is absolutely fantastic, from the radio station selections to the voiceover quality and variety. Rockstar clearly put in some extra money here and it shows, with the game always feeling authentic sound-wise from street sounds to cars to environmental noises in the wilderness. Rockstar absolutely nailed this, and I think it'll absolutely set a bar for future open-world games to hit. One slight downside is that listening to the same few radiostations means you're probably going to know every song the station can play pretty early on into the game. Not the biggest deal in the world, but more songs are always appreciated and they could easily be updated with new DLC content down the road too.

ONLINE/MULTIPLAYER
This is the main reason why I haven't given GTA a 5 star rating, because how GTA Online is going to play out is largely unknown. While based on the trailer it looks like it's going to be a lot of fun, it's simply not out yet for me to pass judgement on and so I'm going to defer giving my final score until I see what Rockstar has to offer on this front.

WRAP-UP
GTA V is a lot of fun with a rich open-world to explore and keep yourself entertained in for hours on end. Is it perfect, no, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have a lot to offer. It's the random crazy things that happen to you along the way that I remember most. Here's 1 of my most memorable moments. I started out driving down sunset blvd in a new mercedes SL that I just bought for Franklin since he just wrapped up a big heist and had some spending money. I got it all tricked out with the latest engine upgrades and a fresh paint job to top it off. As I pulled out of the auto-shop my screen flashed and the opportunity came up for me to stop a thief. So I did my civic duty and ran the guy down in my shiny new car and went to bring the poor guy his wallet. What ends up happening is a car I didn't see rams into me and pushes me into the poor guy waiting for his wallet and the police car sirens started to screech. I was already up at 2 stars and they were gunning right behind me. Thankfully I had my upgraded car to help me make a quick getaway at first, but then some cop cars slid around to stop me and I accidentally rammed right into several street cops at a barrier, up to 4 stars. Now the cops were really gunning for me, and I ended up driving up a parking structure all the way to the top to help avoid the chopper on my tail. I shot out the pilot of the chopper and saw it crash down into some more cop and FBI cars below, 5 stars. Only way off that roof was courtesy of a stunt ramp which I happily revved up my engine to take. After gunning it for the jump I ended up doing a flip and landing perfectly (completely by accident), and making my way to a construction site to hide out. I found a nice little corner tucked away from site, and decided to go and check my stocks, make a few trades, and rush right back out to avoid the cop car getting a little too close. I end up making a run for the mountains hitting ever winding turn at near top speed thanks to my car's upgrades. I see a nice place in the woods to go hide the car and watch the choppers and FBI scramble around to find me. Then I get out of my car, behind the ""Hollywood"" sign and take in the sights before making my way back to Franklin's mansion. That was all a completely unscripted random event, and though it doesn't always work out this neatly it sure it a lot of fun every time.",A fun open-world filled with random stuff to do,1379980800,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

You're stranded on an island and have a series of tasks to complete to get off. Now, it's not like previous games where the tasks are so cut and dry that they're literally written out for you. You have to really explore and think critically about what you're doing to move ahead. You don't meet goals, but rather collect items and help out other castaways so that you can recieve the tools or abilities necessary to move on in the game. And of course, you have to maintain your needs. There are barriers that keep you from moving on until you've completed certain tasks, so the game is paced, but it does take some buildup of skill and knowledge of the game to figure out what to do next.

It does get a little monotonous collecting all of the items to completely finish the game. You can actually ""win"" and find a way off the island pretty easily and early on, but when I reached that point I had only found 45% of what existed on the island.

The layout is very different from previous games, almost set in a side-scrolling fashion, but there are features that eliminate tedious tasks. For example,a map selection screen that lets you select your location and land there automatically so that you don't have to walk from location to location--it's a nice feature, you'll see. ;)

The graphics honestly aren't much better than previous games, and my hands get a little tired from having to hold the stylus, prop up the console, and manage the control  pad to move the screen back and forth (not necessary, but it's a nice option), but it definitely has me just as addicted as the last several Sims games.",Nice and Different,1198627200,3,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo DS'},

Even so, it made for a very fine game, and a quite successful one to boot. Well, all successful games have their imitators, and so ""Dungeons & Dragons: Heroes"" was born. If ""Dark Alliance"" was thin on roleplaying, then ""Heroes"" is downright skeletal. It bears even more of a resemblance to ""Gauntlet"" than its predecessor... but it's actually a solid game, despite its flaws.
You get to pick from four different hero types at the beginning of the game (fighter, wizard, rogue, or cleric), you give that character a name, and you're on your way into the realm of Bael, where an evil wizard is rising to overthrow all that is good and just in the world. A familiar setup, to be sure - yet it gets the job done, particularly since the storyline is clearly not much of an emphasis in the game. Even so, the game's animated cutscenes are quite well rendered, and convey that tiny sliver of story in an entertaining fashion. The rest of the time, you roam the world in a way that's highly reminiscent of ""Gauntlet"" or the aforementioned ""Dark Alliance,"" except now you have complete control over the game's camera. You can rotate your view or zoom in or out to your heart's content. Even so, it tends to be a bit of a hassle, particularly in the cooperative mode. It doesn't help that playing from the furthest zoom makes you and your enemies so tiny you can barely see what's happening, or that at the closest zoom the walls and other bits of scenery can completely obscure your vision in the midst of a brutal fight.
Camera niggles aside, the action is well-handled for a game of this type. There are a thousand monsters waiting to throw themselves at your sword, and hacking, slashing, and casting your way through them can be quite enjoyable. The enemies are many and varied, and in later levels become rather challenging (despite the game's overall simplicity, I mean, but more on that in a second). Each area of the game comes complete with a nasty boss monster as well, and even though they're exactly what you would expect from a D&D game (beholder, dragon, lich, etc.), they make for some exciting battles. Even so, I never once failed to destroy one of these end level baddies on my first attempt. In fact, I never died only to find myself having to restart from my last saved game, and that's because the game is so generous with gold that you can literally build a surplus of health potions and continues (or special items that allow you to resurrect on the spot). So despite the swarming opponents you'll face, you'll never feel all that threatened. That can be good or bad, I suppose, depending on how you look at it, but because the game is so easy it also feels very short.
The game gets off to a bad start. The first cavernous area you're forced to explore is the very definition of bland. The next area, which comprises the forest just outside of Castle Bael, is a little better, but not by much, and the aforementioned fortress stronghold isn't anything to write home about either. Even so, things do start to get a whole lot better as you progress. Even though it's more than a little contrived, you'll eventually wander through an ice-encrusted snowscape, a fiery ironworks, and a pyramid-spattered jungle, the variety is nice and makes you forget just how boring the first few episodes actually were.
In the end, I liked ""Dungeons & Dragons: Heroes."" If you're a fan of ""Dark Alliance,"" this is a good way to spend your time until ""Dark Alliance II"" comes out. ""Gauntlet"" fans should also take notice. Still, it has its share of problems, and does not match the quality of either game previously mentioned.

Using what few resources she can find, she must make her way back to her apartment, then eventually to the town of Silent Hill to uncover her bizarre past. Combat is slow and clunky, but as with all games of this type the main emphasis is on story and riddles...not action.

I think it looks really good, is made well, provides great protection for my New 3DS XL (Majora's Mask edition). I did have the purple Majora's Mask case, and this one is SO much more space efficient. It's fantastic. There are a few very poor design flaws however.
1) The strap is connected on the inside of the case, so to actually use the strap, it needs to come out from between the 2 zippers. This looks strange, shortens the overall length of the strap, and I don't know how anyone ever approved this.
2) Speaking of the strap, I have fairly small hands, and I can't imagine how someone with man-sized hands would be able to use this strap.
3) While using the strap, the fantastic looking image on the front of the case is upside-down... This is unfortunate because it is one of the main appeals of the case.

To correct most of these, I am planning to take out the existing strap (which is black), and sew on a green one from the outside, on the opposite end of the existing one, that is maybe an inch longer.

First of all, I am not slamming the flight missions in any way. They're the one aspect of the Rogue Squadron games that have always rocked. It's the on-foot missions that bring the game down a bit. For starters, it just feels so clunky, and taking control of the heavy-repeating blaster (the gun that the Storm Troopers use) is a little frustrating since the aim centers.
As for the flight missions, they are so tight. My favorite mission so far is Attack on the Executor. You actually get the chance to take on the Super-Star Destroyer Executor (the ship that crashed into the Death Star in Return of the Jedi).

If you've played any of the Warriors saga, you know exactly what you're in for. A series of battles, based loosely on historical events in Japanese hisory. Gigantically huge groueps of enemies that you plow through, building up chained attacks to create sweeping blows, much like Sauron did in the introductory scene to Lord of the Rings. You find chests, items and power-ups lying around the field to give you extra powers.  There are a few 'named characters' on the map to take down, but you're primarily sweeping through nameless minions.

There is some character customization here. First, you choose from amongst about 25 different characters, some which you unlock as you play. Then you can customize these characters as you build up their experience, to match your gameplay style. However, this isn't a RPG at all. This is a quick and easy hack and slash game. There are some people who will find this boring - or completely unnecessary given that there were many other Warriors games before this one.  Do we really need another one with only slightly better graphics?

I happen to be one of those people who really loves this type of game. Yes, I enjoy the more complex, long epic games that you play for months, solving puzzles and advancing plotlines. However, sometimes I am just exhausted from work and want to do something mindless and immediately satisfying. I love the Japanese culture and really enjoy running around in a feudal Japanese environment, with my chosen-type bodyguards staying with me at every moment, blowing away thousands of enemies in a sweep. It's instant accomplishment, and if I only have 15 minutes to play, I can rack up a ton of kills in that time.

There's a new mini-game here, sort of like Samurai Monopoly, but I found it a little silly. I have enough other online boardgames that if that's what I want to do, I can do that with good graphics and gameplay. I'd rather that Samurai Warriors 2 put their spare time into other fun mini-games of the action variety, not into a board game. Still, I just don't play it. If other people enjoy that, have fun.  It's like the cut scenes. They get really silly at times, so I just ignore them. It's the gameplay itself that I enjoy.

As you know this game is epic. Epic with a capital ""E"". The problem is this: you go from running around on mile high ""steeds of time"" to a swamp. Not an epic swamp, just a swamp. From plummeting through the air wrestling Icarus to running through a cave (note: Typhon's cave is an epic cave, but I'm referring to the boring later paths). Epic is good, but it is not consistent. The bland stuff is jarring and stands out from the rest of the game.
The game's puzzles are bad. Not bad difficult - bad totally unnecessary. Most are easy, for example get a block to put on a lever. The problem is that you go from a fast paced battle with a dozen monsters to a move the block puzzle. It totally breaks the flow of the game. Also the puzzles in this game are far greater in number and worse in content than the first game.
The new weapons are unimpressive. ""Athena's"" blades are great, but they do seem a bit similar to the blades of Chaos. I love rage of the titans but quite similar to rage of the gods. Euryale's head is fun, but, hmmm... a head that turns things to stone? C'mon. Just call them Chaos, the god's, and Medusa's respectively and stop pretending that they are even remotely new. The barbarian hammer is cool, but the other weapons are really not useful.
Also much of the story is good, but there are some big plot holes. One that was especially confusing is someone does something dramatic to you in the beginning, you do the same to Zeus (several times), and once to someone else with vastly different results each time.

Now this is a positive review, but just to boil down the only real negative: When the game goes it is great, but stopping points like puzzles detract from the game. The great visuals should have been consistent and the old weapons could have been left intact, but those are minor issues.

Having said that, this is still a game that you need to play. Those issues are minor compared to the positives. Also most of the game's combat hasn't really changed from the first game, so it still has the great combos with gruesome finishing moves.
There are many great things about this game and some are so perfect that I need to mention them. First when you start the game you would select new game and the difficulty and seamlessly go from the title screen to the first cut scene. NO LOADING! If you have seen that title screen you may recognize it as the ending scene from GOW. In other words continuing from the first game the story does not miss a step. In fact all of the cut scenes are of an extremely high quality and for the most part are long on story, but relatively short in length. Also I must give respect to the voice talent. Linda Hunt's voice is back to narrate and is everywhere in the game. Michael Clark Duncan was memorable as Atlas and Harry Hamlin as Perseus was inspired casting.
There were a number of situations that were supported by the epic nature of the game. For example early in the game you can see those ""Steeds of Time"" from a huge distance. Those horses are your destination and when you finally reach them you can't help feeling tiny against these huge creatures. Or near the end when Clotho trash talks you from a huge distance, then later you run right around her quite hefty build. It puts a dramatic perspective for your travels.

I would suggest this game to anyone who enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/God-of-War/dp/B0002XL3BA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">God of War</a>., but ultimately if I had to choose one over the other the first one was a bit better.

This online rendition of Tetris is fun and addictive, and worth the purchase if you're into Tetris.  Casual players not looking for an online challenge would be best picking up a used Gameboy rendition.
The online play is great with a number of different modes to try.  My favorite mirrors the old Gameboy link up version (where achieving double, triple, or tetris moves adds lines to your opponent).  Tons of fun, and you'd be surprised how lousy you really are at it :).
My only complaints are more annoyances than anything else.  The controls could be a little tighter (perhaps it's just the Xbox controller isn't designed for this kind of gameplay).  The authors have deviated a bit from standard tetris rules, and allow players to 'bank' an unwanted (or wanted) piece to later.  Pieces don't 'lock in' until you're done moving them, taking away a bit of the challenge.

It still has a lot of the same obnoxious problems from the last 7 versions.
-You STILL cannot skip a lot of stuff, including the opening cinematic of ALL mini-games.  That gets old rather fast.  You also cannot skip viewing computer player traveling on the board, etc.  Also, the general pacing of the game is still in the range of 6-7, fast, but not quite fast enough.
-Some of the mini-games are the SAME mini-game from previous versions of Mario Party.  This isn't a crime, but there were more than I thought there would be.  They usually re-work them to use motion controls, or have a different theme though.
-Random luck games are still alive and well.  These types of games tend to drive ""good"" players up the wall.
-Not as much variety in the game as I had hoped for its Wii debut -- very similar to MP6 & 7.
-The motion controls are not as precise as I would have hoped.  If you have played Wii Sports, Wii Play, or Raving Rabbids, you know what I am talking about -- same deal here.

Now that the bad is out of the way, the rest is pretty good.  There are 5 main zones in the game to choose from, which is set in a carnival this time around.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Party Tent: you do exactly what you have done in every other MP.  Pick characters, set options, choose a board, and play.  There are 3 main modes in the main party mode.  You can choose ""Battle Royale"" which is the traditional Mario Party 1-4 player game.  ""Tag Battle"" is the traditional teams setup, and a new mode is ""Duel Battle"" which is JUST for 1-2 players, and this is where the previous version's versus modes, and play types are all banished now.  The Duel Battle mode is a fast paced game, and is MOSTLY just the board game.  The only time you play mini-games is when one of you lands on a versus space.  If you like the board game more than the mini-games, you will LOVE this mode, if not, you will HATE this mode.

In the regular games, there is also a new type of space called a ""Lucky"" space, it causes you to generally go to a special area of the board to get a nice bonus (usually with a star) or something special to happen.  Also new are coin block spaces, and the fact that the DK spaces share the same space with the Bowser spaces (once a DK space has been landed on it switches to a Bowser space, and vice versa.

Finally ""Candy"" has replaced ""orbs"" as power ups.  Same basic idea, but now they are only for power ups, no placing them on the board (that I have seen so far anyway).  Similar to the power ups in MP4.

The Available boards at start are:
""DK's Treetop Temple"" - classic MP board, plays like you would expect it to play.

""Goomba's Booty Boardwalk"" - this is a weird board.  It is a single pathway to the end.  Coins are used to get to the end fast, because the star is free, lots of strategy on this one.  The Spring and Whirlwind powers are very useful here.

""King Boo's Haunted Hideaway"" - This board is a maze that is always changing, you are looking for the hidden star room in it, this board can be frustrating.

""Shy Guy's Perplex Express"" - The board is set on a train that randomizes itself.  The path goes through the train, and then back over the top of it.

""Koopa's Tycoon Town"" - This board is similar to the Windmill board in MP7, you buy hotels on the board to get their stars.  You can steal a hotel from another player by putting more coins into one.  The combined coins in a hotel can upgrade it to a 2 or 3 star hotel.  Once it is a 3 star hotel an extra 100 coins from the owner can make it impossible to steal (coins are very important on this board!)

Also viewable, but not playable yet is ""Bowser's Warped Orbit"" which is locked at start
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Star Battle Arena: you play through the single player game, similar in theme and design to MP6 & 7.  There is the twist of progressive rankings and a ladder of achievement to climb though.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Mini-Game Tent: you can play all of the mini-games you have unlocked, just like in previous versions of the game.  The 5 modes you can play in right at the start are:
""Freeplay Arcade"" - which is exactly what it says it is (1-4 players).
""Crown Showdown"" - locked at first, you need lots of mini-games unlocked to play.
""Flipout Frenzy"" - you compete to win 'tiles' on the game board (every tile you own also claims unclaimed tiles to the 4 directions surrounding it) flip as many tiles as you can by winning games (1-4 players).
""Tic-Tac Drop"" - basically a game of tic-tac-toe, with the right to move next given to whomever wins the next game.
""Test For The Best"" - locked at first, buy from the 'Fun Bazaar.'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Extras Zone: you can trade in ""carnival cards"" to unlock stuff, similar to the stars in MP6.  You get cards for winning games, and playing the various modes.  This is also where your Miis can play for you, instead of the MP8 characters.  You can use the Miis on the Wii itself, or Miis stored in a wii-mote.  Available when you first get the game are 4 games:
""Bowling"" - basically like Wii Sports bowling, but with less finesse and control. (1-4 players)
""Trial By Tile"" - is a matching game similar to Memory (1-2 players).
""Flagging Rights"" - REQUIRES THE NUNCHUCK ATTACHMENT!  This is the only game I have seen (so far) that allows or requires it.  It is a matching game, you hold up your hands to mimic the prompts on screen. (1-2 players).
""Canyon Cruisers"" - Is a motion controlled vehicle racing game.  You twist the remote left or right to steer, and use buttons to brake or accelerate.  This game requires some seriously cool hands to play, it is difficult (1-2 players).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Fun Bazaar: you unlock stuff, just like in previous versions of MP.  The most interesting stuff to unlock is to the immediate right of the main cart you view, this is where you can unlock new modes, new games, and new difficulty levels.  This is where you trade in your 'Carnival Cards.'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Over all, it is a fun game.  As with ANY party game with mini-games, it tends to be only as fun as those you are playing with.  We have a good group to play with, and we like it.  Some of the games are addictingly fun, and we really enjoy, some of them are very cheap, and annoy the heck out of you (as has been the case in every MP.)

the only real drawbacks I see with it right now are that Sony isn't taking advantage of it's memory card to make downloadable games available and the battery - the battery life isn't nearly long enough - if you're a constant user like me you'll have to recharge at least once a day.

The single player is fairly lengthy, with a lot of fun achievements, and a replayability of at least 2 runs through the campaign, maybe three. (I'm on my second playthrough, and might do one more) By far, the biggest problem in singleplayer is the AI. The enemy ALWAYS knows where you are. It doesn't really make the game terribly difficult, it just makes it a bit boring. There's no way to be sneaky, you can't snipe, you just have to run in to the battle every time. It doesn't pay to hide and fire from far away. Once you fire your first shot, every enemy within range instantly knows where you are and begins lobbing rather large pieces of metal at your skull. Feels fake. Your AI is also useless, but I guess that's normal...

The multiplayer is very fun too, although grossly imbalanced, not in kits, but in the side you play. If you play Defense, 80%+ of the time you will win, and if you play offense, >20% of the time will you be victorious. This isn't a deal breaker, and it it doesn't make the game miserable, but it's a bit frustrating when your team is obviously better than the opposing team, but try as you might, you can't destroy all the enemy objectives. This is a minor issue that will be fixed soon in a patch however. The bigger issue is that vehicles are a bit too tough/powerful. They're quite difficult to kill, and can be a bit irratating when they spawn camp. Once again, however, it's not a dealbreaker. Hopefully DICE will include a no-vehicle mode later on. *PLEASE PLEASE, DICE!!*

Overall, I'd give it an 8 or 9/10. We'll see as I continue to run through the multiplayer.

The combat is bad, especially at first when you don't have enough XP to level up your gun accuracy. The graphics are strange, being really high resolution, yet primitive at the same time. Many cant overlook these problems... but here's the kicker

This game is amazing. The story starts off interestingly enough, but it keeps getting better and better. Your main character is a spy, never before has your dialogue choices felt soooo meaningful. This game puts Bioware games to shame in regards to dialogue and there consequences of your actions. Friends can become enemies, enemies friends! You can talk people into betraying the main bad guy, you can JOIN the main bad guy. Making someone like you, is NOT always the best option, sometimes you might want someone to hate you, to have a personal vendetta against you so he fights you to his last, allowing you to kill him, otherwise he'll run away.

The RPG aspect is also very cool, leveling up hand to hand, stealth, guns, gadgets and technical skills, mechanical skills, and 3 different types of armor you can buy and upgrade giving you 3 unique play style options. You can make your guy super sneaky, give him the top tier sneak armor and level up hand to hand and make him play like... Bat Man, punching and choking people out. OR say eff it, and grab heavy armor, going in loud and proud, only changing your assault strategy to beating them senseless when you want to avoid casualties (my favorite way to play)

Which brings up ANOTHER issue... the game takes note of who you kill and DONT kill. If you do a mission racking up bodies, make sure you want to be seen as an opperative that kills those types of people. Are they Islamic extremists literally no one in the game would care about? Are they a rogue intelligence operation who you actually want to get on your side? Mercenaries? Russian thugs? A BOSS character who would return several times in the story even be called upon to save your ass at times?

While not picking on a particular review, it is general comments like this... ""treyarch just can't live up to infinity ward""... that make me cringe. Like many people, I have COD3, COD4 and now COD:World at War (WaW). Guess which one I like the least.....COD4. While all three games are good (great), to me, it is the multiplayer that separates them from each other. On single player, I have only finished COD3 (I'm in the middle of COD4, and halfway through COD:WaW). That is enough for me to say that they are all equal. Multiplayer on COD4 is an absolute joke. I hate it more than anything I have ever played .... and that says a lot. I admit I am not the best player in the world and that is the problem. If I join a game, I can't get any kills in COD4 because I am up against all these high ranked players that can kill me in 1 second because of either their increased skill level or worse yet, their better weapons. Thus, I can't level up. Too many times, I finish a game with 0 kills and don't even have the chance to level up. Go ahead, make comments that I am not good....I know it.

I have no problem with people complaining about legitimate issues (spawn points, etc) but the comparison between Infinity Ward and Treyarch is just getting old. The only advantage COD4 has over the rest of these games is that it was in a modern age which I do prefer.

369112,4.0,False,"03 19, 2017",A1VGKCSOKKB80P,B00LCHZRIK,M. Brown,"Let me be honest and up front - I bought a refurbed Wii-U from Nintendo directly to play this game. After the disappointment in Nintendo's development practices and sheer stupidity with the Wii (The Operation Rainfall games really left a bad taste, look those up if you don't know that story), I wrote off the Wii U and focused on PC gaming until last year's Super Mario Maker came out. I told my wife, they make one more killer app, we might need to give them another try.  Here it is, the sendoff for the Wii U, Breath of the Wild. I'm now around 10 hours in and have a lot to say that I think you might appreciate about this game.

The Good:
-Open World: This game is a dream-come-true for me, an idea that formed when I played Shadow of the Colossus back in college. Why couldn't they make that kind of game an open world RPG? Breath of the Wild does it superbly. Many games say ""If you can see it, you can go to it;"" this game delivers that promise and then some. Bear in mind that it's not always easy to traverse - there are climbs, sheer drops, weather, and other factors to manage to get to that amazing vista you want to check out or up that castle to see what's there, but you can do it. And you should, it's amazing and the game rewards you for exploring it. Most of my time is simply spent saying ""that looks neat, let's go check it out."" And off we go, for another couple of hours of unfettered adventure. This reminds me of the promise of games like The Elder Scrolls and Fallout series, actually brought to completion. I love this feature and would recommend on this alone.
-Story: It's dark, post-apocalyptic, but still retains the features that make a real Zelda game. And the way the game is designed you can pretty much experience it in any order you want just by going off the beaten path. The more you learn about this game's backstory and how the world became what Link wakes up to is fascinating and makes his discoveries in it our discoveries, and that's an amazing feat.
-NO HAND HOLDING: Japanese games over the years have really started to grind my gears in terms of just how long you spend staring at tutorials and expositions to get you into the game world and interacting with the systems. None of that here. Even your first guide in the game tells you at one point to ""trust your judgment"" when locating some spots on the map, which has few markers other than places you find. This is not a Ubisoft game where somehow you know every location of every place and encounter. Nintendo is giving you the player a huge amount of trust that you will find your way and have a good time while doing it, with is HUGE for this company on many levels.
-Risk/Reward and Challenge: I died seven separate times while playing in one two-hour session, from seven separate things. I jumped into a frigid lake and froze to death. I got shot by a laser and died. I got hit by a giant rock and died. And numerous times misjudged an enemy and died. The difference between this game and the rage-quit inducing Dark Souls series, by contrast, is that every one of these deaths were my fault and could be avoided (no spamming or failing to grind enough here). Every challenge has that cycle of risk reward - do you take on the enemy encampment to raid their treasure boxes or avoid it and live to fight another day? That's all up to you.
-Crafting: Lots of it in the form of food, potions, and elixirs. Reminds me vaguely of Monster Hunter here, but much more friendly. You can combine ingredients to make a wide range of status buffs (resistance to cold and increased speed or stamina, for example, very handy when you head into certain mountainous areas). What's great here is that the game hints at what works together, rather than give you all the answers. Experiment and see what works for you.
-Weapons and Armor: So. Many. Weapons. Sure, most of them are disposable with different durabilities, but there are a number of classes of weapons that all perform differently for different situations, and have the ability to charge attack for massive damage and a neat animation for each weapon class. Anything from Link's classic sword and shield combo, to spears, axes, hammers, clubs, and many types of bows and arrows, all at your disposal. I beat an enemy with a skeletal arm in a pinch. You read that right.

The Bad:
-The Graphics/Performance: My ONLY complaint really, is that this game is UGLY on my 1080p television, with jagged edges and issues with the shadows. Add to that some wild dips in FPS at times and you really are looking at a game that could have used just a little more polish or the ability to turn off shadows. Reports show that even on the switch it has issues on TVs. Both systems, though, change things up when you play from the handheld side. On Wii-U, it's a drastic change; softer lines, more blended shadows, and overall a smoother experience. I hope Nintendo continues to patch this game and eventually we see the drops in FPS diminish a bit, but for now it is noticeable. Truly this is what takes this game from 5 to 4 for me, but clearly not a deal-breaker.

All in all, this was an excellent purchase for me and I highly recommend you try this game out. I bought and now support the Wii U quite a bit more for it, totally worth the cost while Nintendo modifies the switch a few times to get everything right. If you're a current Wii U owner, even better for you. Play this game. Simple.","I had all but given up on Nintendo, but...",1489881600,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii U'}",

The G110 is something that even a casual gamer should be delighted to have. The Game Mode button alone is such a brilliant feature, as it prevents you from kicking yourself out of a game by hitting the Windows key when you meant to hit ALT.

The included Logitech software made setting up the keyboard easy, and it isn't nearly as resource-hungry as I had expected it to be. And if you enjoy gaming in the dark, as any decent human being would, they backlit keys are bright without being distracting.

As for the macro keys, they're excellent, and well placed. The scroll wheel is nothing short of wonderful in terms of placement and response. And the price is reasonable.

So, back to how Logitech missed the five-star mark...

Why, in this day and age, does anyone put low-power USB ports on anything? Sure, it's primarily there for a headset, but come on!

And while the keyboard is built well, and is packed with functionality, it doesn't feel like a keyboard that costs this much. I'm not expecting Model M type of industrial quality, but the tactile feel isn't a very big jump from what many OEM keyboards feel like. Again, you're getting lots of functionality, but that's apparently where most of the cost is derived from.

All said, if you're a casual gamer who needs a new keyboard anyway, spending some extra cash on a G110 is definitely worth considering. If you're spending your evenings and weekends behind a keyboard, this almost certainly belongs in your arsenal.",Logitech was so close...,1262908800,,,

I don't think I've used a keyboard with such a great tactile feel and satisfying audible feedback since my original IBM AT keyboard. The amount of force required to type is perfectly balanced, for me.  I can rest my hands on the keys without accidental strokes.  Previous membrane keyboards felt like they required more force to register strokes, so typing on the G610 feels effortless.
The backlighting makes it easier to use in low light setting.  Although the board has a button that allows you to change brightness of the backlighting, the default setting is to have the keys light up in a 'wave'.  Since the human eye is attracted to motion, I find it very distracting to have a wave of light travel across my keyboard. I wish the default setting was to have a constant backlighting, so this is where my rating falls to 4 stars.  I'd prefer to not install more software on my PC, but I was forced to install Logitech's software to control the backlighting.
Another minor complaint is the placement of the caps lock/scroll lock/num lock indicator lights.  To make room for media control buttons, the indicator lights were moved to the top middle of the board, where it is not so intuitive to figure out which light is which.  There are labels etched under each light, but they are unreadable, even in decent lighting levels.

Its sequel, Revenant Wings is similarily flawed but its not as disappointing and while there's several gameplay aspects and features that aren't as impressive or well-done, it's still quite a joy to play and should appeal to fans of its epic big brother.

Story: Taking place after the events of the first game, Vaan and his companion Penelo are sky pirates who stumble across an old airship that takes them to the floating land of Lemures populated by the aegyl, humes (humans) with wings on their back. But such a wondrous and highly talked about land of legend means others want to exploit and so Vaan, Penelo as well as new friends and old buddies try to stop those who wish to use Lemures treasures for their own.

Graphics: The graphics might invoke more a combination of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance and the Mana series rather than the first game which is fine and all since the game's quite colorful but then again, characters look more younger despite it being a sequel and there's on occasion some slowdown but when you have just as impressive FMV's as the remake of III, all those nitpicks kind of get thrown out the window.

Sound/Music: The first soundtrack without series mainstay Nobuo Uematsu, XII's soundtrack was epic and grandiose in its arrangements but rather forgettable in its melodies which made Uematsu's music such a pleasure since not only was it well composed, but it was hummable at the same time. Revanent Wings is pretty much the same soundtrack as XII's but sometimes it's more welcome here. No voice acting to speak of.

Gameplay: The battle system was refreshing in XII since gone were the random battles and its place was a MMORPG-inspired system with attacks requiring a certain amount of time before they're activated. The battle system in the DS game is similar but it's mission-based a la Tactics and characters roam the field fighting, healing and other such stuff. Aiding in your quest are espers, enemies that you ""summon"" into battle to help you fight the legions of baddies in a given level. Taking over an enemy's summon gate allows you to touch the gate and call even more espers which range from melee, ranged, and flying. It's a fun little system and while you can use different esper groups to battle different foes, it's best to just make everyone unleash on the enemy at once.

Which comes to one of my two nitpicks: the field can get crowded with not only your members (up to 9 main characters but 5 in a field) and a certain limit of espers not to mention the large amounts of baddies that can populate the field, it's hard to pick a certain member of your team to cure your fighters or to get a party member out of the way lest they get knocked out. The other is the way you level up: what made the original funner at levelling up was that you could go around the level and just stomp enemy after enemy without having to leave the screen, get the fanfare and your spoils etc but now that's back and it makes exp gaining slightly tedious since you have to keep replaying Melees to get your characters up in levels. Not to mention the game's difficulty is unbalanced at times with a fine cruising pace then all of a sudden the enemies seemed to level up faster than I do or I just got overwhelmed.

While the story is a bit more simplistic than XII's political-intrigue filled narrative and the gameplay is unbalanced, fans of the series would be good to give Revenant Wings a go.",Uneven but still a joy,1199318400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The game is ONLY in japanese, with english subtitles, which is not my preferred way of playing JRPGs. You can't play the game through the gamepad, as its used as a text messaging tool in game, and for that reason you also can't route the audio through the game pad with headphones either, all audio goes through the TV. I play my games late at night, so this was a problem for me and I had to get an adapter to plug my headphones directly into the TV, which makes volume control difficult.

Those things aside, the gameplay and upgrade system is awesome.

LBP2 is the best in the series to me and I felt the only way it could be better is if the campaign were longer by having more levels. In LBP3, you have the core gameplay tweaked in enough areas to where it actually felt like a true sequel but it also felt like less of a game because you went from 30 story levels in the previous game, now shortened down to 20 levels. It's not much of a big deal because you need to do some of the side levels for quests but for a game that relies on imagination and creativity, I feel like a game of that nature should have more ideas to work with and more worlds and levels to tackle. When you unlock Swoop, you only have about 3 more levels until the game is over. There should have been at least one ore two more Books (worlds) to explore to help balance out the game by giving the player more chances to play as the other characters that weren't Sackboy.

As far as the glitches, save corruption and freezes go, it's also weird. Many reviews complained about the game being broken yet I never ran into a single freeze nor save issue throughout my time pre and post patch. As far as glitches, I ran into a few. Sometimes I'd watch my Sack person go to reach for a platform only for the camera to jerk away and my character would be in a totally different area. That happened a few times while trying to Ace levels, which would suck as it got me killed in the process. The only MAJOR glitch I ran into was the prize bubbles. It's the only LBP game that doesn't require you to collect all of them for a trophy and yet it's amazing that they didn't go that route because of how broken it is. The prize bubbles progress sometimes gets reset to 0% each time you turn off the game, so you would be screwed each time you played the game and would have most likely had to do everything in one run. I've read that this has recently been patched, so you want to make sure to get the latest updated version of the game downloaded to the system.

It's a good sequel but the game's ideas could have been more explored. This might be the last LBP game I ever buy.

As for someone whose played the other Shantae games I have to say this falls disappointing compared to pirate's curse. They made the game feel more like Mario with worlds, instead of being semi open world it's now you go through that door you can't go back until you restart the level.  I'm just going to straight to the pros and cons then blab

Pros
- It's 3D shantae
- Music
- Classic Side scrolling
- Getting 100% without a guide is tricky
- Quick play is challenging (beating the game before 2 hours)
- Cheap, game is worth what I payed for it, bought it digitally for 20$, and got a physical copy to collect for 30 in gamestop of release. ( I don't trust amazon with collector items they always have a dent or a sticker on the box)

Cons
- No more dungeons, just platform levels( people complain about them being short, but even in pirates curse as you progressed the levels got shorter)
- Nintendo easy, this game is literally way too easy, the only challenging part was when i was going through my first play through and I was having fun by trying not to get hit by the boss at all learning their patterns, my quick run play through with no heart holders really made it bloody hell. But anyone can get Bikini armor take half damage from everything, then collect all the items get infinite mana to get an invincible shield where you can't get hurt... really ruins the game for those with trigger fingers
- A lot of returning to old zones and i mean A LOT , you have to go back to the same areas about 3 times + if you're going for 100%, or just wait till you get to the end game to just go back once, but even the main story makes you come back.

In my defense the cons obviously outweigh the pros, but I'm really glad they made another Shantae game, it's better than just leaving it a pirate's curse. I had a blast playing this game, I actually platted it before i did Pirate's curse.

237554,4.0,False,"12 12, 2012",A1IQV6AI7L9NOK,B0050SVMYA,Feelah the tigress,"I finally got around to buying a 3DS and selling off my old DS lite.  I'd been putting them off forever waiting for the price to drop, and good thing I did (since the price really did drop drastically)!  Well, I've had a chance to play at least one game on it, and to mess around with it in general.

I can't help but feel that it's got a number of flaws that hold it back from being quite as satisfying as the DSlite was.  The 3DS feels a bit top heavy, as though the top half is a bit heavier than the bottom.  The audio jack is right at the bottom of the bottom of the unit, which means that if you are laying in bed with the 3DS resting on your chest while you play, you can't use the audio jack (same problem as the DSlite had though - I just wished they had changed it).  The stylus holder is in the back of the unit, where it is awkward to get to - it would've been better if the stylus and the audio jack positions were switched.  Also, the shiny finish shows fingerprints, but so did the old DS lite's finish.  I was kind of wishing they'd learned from their mistakes and made them matte to prevent fingerprints.

Also, anyone's who done research on the 3DS would know that they all have a common problem where the unit can close too tightly and cause the bottom screen to put scratches on the top screen.  I had to attach bumpers to the top screen's corners to prevent this problem.  The 3DS also has a really crap battery life compared to the DSLite (literally 3 hours to the DS Lite's 10 hours).  Whenever you try to turn off the unit, it forces you to tap a thing on-screen first, all while warning you that you could just leave it in sleep mode.  WHY would a handheld with a battery this poor encourage you to leave it on?!  I've since learned that it's possible to skip having to tap the button by just pressing and holding the power button until it turns off.  It's madness!

Alright, now that I've complained endlessly, let's talk about the actual features and good points of the 3DS.  The 3DS feels solidly built, and seems to function well in general.  I suppose the biggest draw of the 3DS for most people would be the 3D aspect.  I've found that the 3D effect does work perfectly, but it does give me a bit of a headache and so I usually keep it turned off.  I suspect that eventually it'll be recognized for the gimmick it is, and largely ignored by everyone.  Other than that, I suppose the other draw of the unit is the better internet browser.  It is indeed a nice internet browser that actually works well.  I can't complain there.  I do like the option to pause a game and exit to the main menu to use the internet browser (good for looking up FAQs) or to make notes using the in-game note-taking mechanic.  That's a rather nice feature.  It also seems like the 3DS is a good choice in terms of game library as many of the series you may have been a fan of of the DS have sequels coming out on the 3DS.  Of course, the 3DS is backwards compatible with older DS games, and that works fine.  DS games do look worse on the 3DS due to the increased screen resolution, but it's not too bad.  You can decrease the screen size by holding down Start or Select while tapping the game icon from the menu (just keep holding down the button until you see the game start up).  This improves the resolution but makes the image size tiny, so I don't know how useful that'd really be to anyone.

Overall, I feel like the 3DS has loads more little irritants to its design that I have to fix or put up with.  It just feels like it has more problems right out the gate than the DS Lite did.  Despite this, it's still a solid good quality unit and I'm still glad I bought it.  I'm sure once I get used to it's quirks I won't be as bothered by the problems, and I'll get many years of enjoyment out of my 3DS.","It feels like it has more problems than the DS Lite did, but it's still a solid unit.",1355270400,,,

One of the, if not THE inspiring cinematic game experiences of all time.

First, it's been a while since I played ""Mass Effect 2"" but this version seems even more cinematic.
I remember from the late 90's people taking about incorporating more of an ""interactive story"", talk of movie like like experience, etc.  There has certainly been a lot of moments in games since then had some essence of these but I really felt for the first prominent time that ME3 has finally captured this.
The story telling part so good I felt lost in it for moments at the time.. I felt like I was part of a very compelling movie.

From the beginning I loved it's captivating flow.
And in this version of the series they have seemed to have removed yet more of what I felt was monotony.  For example you no longer have to mine for resources (some times rare) to do upgrades.
It was IMHO kind of a fun feature anyhow but made even better having turned more into an exploratory element.

Although the game not with out it's faults for the genre that it is.
While playing I some times yearned for a more ""sandbox"" style.
I had these: ""Humm I wonder what is up there?"", ""I want to jump over this but I can't!"" - sort of feelings for freedom.
But again this is part of these genre/style that just takes a little getting used to; in particular if you have been playing more open sandbox style games recently.

I won't give any spoilers here (like some other reviewers seem apt to do), but I did briefly read some reviews and, or, heard from friends in particular about the ending(s).
I for one had no problem with it.  It all made sense and was fitting to me.
Again apropos in the cinematic context, do all movies need to have an ending that is expected/likeable.
And are we sure this is really the end? We've all seen weirder things and probably accepted them openly.
For example Spock's resurrection in ""Star Trek III: The Search for Spock"". And yea I know poor Shepard has been resurrected once already.

The Replay Value is Amazing there are about 32 Hidden Characters you can unlock Using a ""point"" system. You get Points by how high you rank on the Ranking Board at the end of the game and a series of other things, like your Biggest Combo, Average Vitality you had at the end of matches and so on.
I think Capcom could of picked some better Marvel Characters besides BlackHeart and Shuma Gorath. I have NO idea who they are. Where's NightCrawler? or Jubilee Even? they would of been better choices besides the other two. And was there really a point in Putting in two Separate Wolverines? Sure the difference is one has Bone claws that are a bit longer,and the other the regular Admantium Claws but come on. Also, The Capcom Roster has it's flaws as well. Roll and ServBot are the most useless Characters ever. Why didn't they put in Chris Redfield? They have Jill.

106267,4.0,False,"11 30, 2008",A2GQZN30PYEJN1,B000Q4SREG,Lady Gryphon,"I'm a 29 year old female and I love playing MySims. I love it so much I bought the MySims game for DS (which is NOT just the same game on the hand held but different enough to warrant the buy) and the new Wii MySims Kingdom game.  I have played The Sims game on the PC before and kind of enjoyed it but it only kept my interest for so long.  I hated the fact that I always had to keep paying attention to the sims and taking care of their basic needs.  Even if I made the sim have a lot of ""neatness"" he/she still threw trash on the floor and sometime forget to flush the toliet after using it or didn't wash his/her hands.  I felt like I was taking care of a bunch of kids.

MySims is completely different.  First off you only create one sim that you control directly like an avatar which made me feel more like I was actually IN the game versus just playing around with an elaborate dollhouse.  The premise is that you just moved into a town that's run-down and the mayor asks for your help to make the town 5 stars again.  You do this by building houses and furniture for other sims in their favorite ""interests"".  There is 78 different sims you can move into your town or kick out if you want (Mayor Rosalyn, the hotel bellhop Buddy and the ghost Cassandra are always in town and can't be moved in or out which makes a total 81 sims to meet).  Each of the sims has two interests they like and one they hate.  When you build the houses for the sims you can use certain items (like windows, doors, flairs, etc) that have the same ""interest"" as the sim or when you paint the furniture you built you can use essences (apples you gather off of trees, stone you prospect out of the ground, fish you fished for) of the same ""interest"" to make the sim like it more.

The more furniture you build for the sims in their interests and the more you are nice to them, the more they like you.  When you become the sim's ""best friend"" they will reward you with either a new blueprint or an item you can use to decorate your own house.  You can always go back and remodel a house or kick one sim out and move another sim in or build different pieces of furniture to make your town exactly how you want it.

Controls:
Over all I found the controls very intuitive and not hard to use. However, when building or fishing for a while my wii remote hand would start to ache from using the B Button so much. Also, I would occasionally get frustrated building the more complicated furniture pieces but that was more the nature of the task was difficult not necessarily a flaw in the controls themselves.

Moving Around -- I found moving around town very easy.  The joystick on the nunchuck is used to move your avatar around town.  To harvest a tree you point at it with the wii remote, press and hold the B button to ""grab"" the tree and just wiggle the wii remote from side to side to ""shake"" the tree.  When you are by something you can interact with like another sim, a tree or while prospecting you will have different interaction options displayed at the bottom of the screen. You just point at the option with the wii remote and press the A button to select (or you could cycle forward through the options with the B button or cycle backwards with the Z button and then A to select).

Fishing -- By bodies of water there are usually docks with a fishing bucket and a fishing rod where you can select the option to fish.  After you select that option your avatar will throw the bobber into the water.  You can move the bobber around with the wii remote.  When you see bubbles on the surface (indicating a fish), you move the bobber over the bubbles, hold down the B button to ""grab"" and then pull up with the wii remote to pull the fish out of the water.  I do find that after a period of time, my wii remote hand starts to ache a little bit from holding the B button.

Prospecting -- In certain areas you can select the option to prospect for different essences.  In the prospecting mode, your sim will be holding something that looks like a metal detector that gives off circles of light of different colors (and makes a beeping noise).  This is like a hot/cold game, the circles will be blue when you are far away (cold) and gradually turn to red as you get closer (hot). After you found something, you will get the option at the bottom of the screen to dig which again you can select by pointing at it with the wii remote and pressing A to select (or just pressing A since it's already selected).

Construction -- Building houses and building furniture use basically the same controls.  For simple items I found the controls relatively easy to use however once I started making more complicated items it got a little tricker but still okay considering how intricate some of the pieces of furniture can be.  You point at a building piece with the wii remote and press A to select it.  Then you point to where you want it and press A again to place.  If you change your mind about placing a piece you are holding you can press the B button to delete the piece (note: it's just the piece you're holding that gets deleted, you can still selected it again if you want to).  The D pad is used to rotate the building piece you are holding. The nunchuck joystick is used to rotate the house/piece of furniture you are building (left and right) and to zoom in and out (up and down). There are more controls than I've listed here that allow you to do things like able to place multiple of the same piece in a row, turn off the ghost image, turn on/off slide under mode, etc.  This is a case where I would definitely recommend reading the instruction manual especially once you try to build more complicated pieces.

Cons:
Other people have mentioned the loading times. Every time you go into a house or into a new area (or back to an area) it needs to re-load so it does take a little bit of time. Overall, I didn't think the loading time was too bad but I knocked a star off more because of the slow down and stuttering AFTER it was done loading.  I especially noticed this as I got farther in the game.  I started waiting ANOTHER 20 secs after it was done loading just for it to catch up and finish reading the disk.  Also, every time it changed from day to night or night to day it slowed down for a little bit.  Occasionally when I was prospecting it was so stuttery I had a really hard time selecting the ""dig"" option (to fix that I would just go to another area and come back to make it load the area again).

By the way, the MySims DS game and the new MySims Kingdom Wii game do NOT have these same loading/slow down issues.

Conclusion:
Even with these issues, I love the game so much that I don't mind dealing with them just so I can play the game.  On the bright side the loading times give me time to plan out what I'm going to do in the area before getting there :)  I think I'm over 80 hours now and even though I got to 5 stars a while ago I still have things I want to do.  I have met all 80 sims but I still haven't made best friends with them all.  I've found all 84 essences (14 for each of the 6 interests) but I haven't gotten all 147 blueprints yet.

You can't upgrade your cars, race modify, or anything other than choose a paint job when you buy the car.  No career mode exists.

There are different types of races and driving challenges to compete in though.  I have only tried circuit racing so far where you set the number of laps and such you want.  You choose your race type, car, and track.

There are dirt tracks and tarmac tracks.

Don't think you can save up and buy a monster car and easily whip your opponents because the game sets you against comparable cars each time.  What you do though is you start each track at it's lowest level, which is usually pretty easy to beat.  As you win each time, you start to unlock that track's higher difficulty levels which pay out more per race.  The AI gets better each time the track level increases, but you can choose to race each track on whatever level you choose as long as you have that level unlocked.  For example, you may start out on level D and work your way up to level A, with A being the harder level.  Well you can go back and race level D all you want still.

There are 2 camera views to race in...cockpit view and chase view.  Cockpit view does not have interior details though, only blackness.  But you see great details outside your windshield as normal while driving in cockpit view.  You also have the replay function after each race, which is nice.

Graphics are really nice and sounds are pretty good such as the background racing music and engine noise for a handheld.

Each day you have only 4 car dealers to choose from with a certain selection of cars to buy.  Each day that changes at random it seems.  So if you see a car you want, race until you have enough money for it and wait for that dealer with that car offered again.  Speaking of cars, you can import your garage to GT5 but they are only available in arcade mode from what i've read...gotta find my USB cable to try that out.

Multi-player is via Ad-hoc from what I gather.  Haven't tried it yet though, but I do know that each player needs a copy of the game as well as their own PSP.

Overall, a really good game for quick racing on the go.  The point of the game, collect the cars and have fun racing.  From there, bring your garage to GT5 and have more cars in arcade mode to race on the big screen.

I eagerly awaited its release and spent quite a few happy hours so far playing it.  (It came on my day off, YAY!)

Here's what I liked:

The graphics. I'm usually one to care less about the ""superiority"" of graphics and the like, but I must say, I wish the original had such nice ones. I've played a lot of games with amazing graphics and these are certainly not the best I've eve seen, but they work well with the game and its premise.

The heroes are pretty much the same from the original.  There's Rangers and Warriors, Elves and Dwarves, Mages and Rogues (I have to say, I never liked the Rogues in the original so I've yet to see what these new ones can do).  I do miss my Monks and Healers and Adepts.  They were my favorites, but the Clerics are growing on me. They're like a mix of Monk and Healer.

Your heroes have the same enthusiasm and wit as the original. I love hearing them talk, even if its the same lines over and over.  They each have their unique conversation pieces and each of them says something unique when they, sadly, die.

You get more peasants to build with.  I HATED that you got so few peasants in the original.  It sometimes took forever to build defenses when you needed them or to keep things repaired.  You get more peasants and they seem to work a lot faster.

Movement.  With the original, you had one direction to look at and one zoom in.  Now I can zoom in and out and turn my view however I want it.

The addition of sidequests.  Some of the scenarios give you other things you must do along with completing your main quest.

New flags.  I love the defend flag I can put on caravans, buildings, and even heroes.

Upgrade buildings without research.  You don't need to research everything in order to add more hitpoints to your buildings.  Just have enough gold!

Auto-cemetery.  In the original, when a hero died, you had only a short time to resurrect them, and then only if you had the right temple and research.  If a bunch of heroes died, a mausoleum auto-spawned but you couldn't do anything but mourn the dead. Now, when even one hero dies, a cemetery spawns and you can resurrect any hero for a price.  You don't even need a Temple to Agrela or Krypta!

Here's what I wasn't so fond of:

Rangers no longer seem to auto-explore.  If you want your map revealed, you better keep building or keep putting out explore flags.

Looks pretty short.  Unlike the original that I could play each scenario over and over and over and get differences each time, this game looks like each scenario is the same over and over again.

Can't build where I want on some things.  Trading posts, for instance, go only where you're told to put them.  Makes them harder to defend.

I liked the variety of things to make and sell and the challenge of fitting everything into limited space. And it's always fun the first time you play a game like this to see what's coming next. It would be more of a challenge, I think, if you could choose what to upgrade next - speedy gloves, boots, machines etc - rather than having the upgrade being available at a given time. Also, if you are playing right you always have more than enough money to buy everything you need. You don't even have to play the Farmer's Market levels to get extra money; just use them to prepare for the next level. So maybe the money earning/spending part is too easy.

It is a little tough scrolling around to get to everything but you get used to it. A nice touch is the distinctive sound effects when the cows give milk, the bees make honey, etc, so you don't have to keep scrolling over to look.

To clarify that last one: every time you cloak, use ""nanovision"" (heat vision), or when you enter a new area the goofy nanosuit computer voice will announce it. Every.time. And there is no way to turn it off.

Overall, a great game with probably the best graphics to date on the 360. The gameplay feels intuitive without being derivative. It'd be perfect if the story wasn't so cliched and confounding.","Good game, great graphics, confused story",1301616000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The pictures are generally well done, although sometimes it can be frustrating when you click on an object and the game doesn't register your click (presumably because you're clicking on the wrong pixel).

The mini-games, such as putting together a jigsaw puzzle, playing mahjongg tiles or playing concentration, are fun enough when they come between the find-the-object puzzles, as part of the main game. You can also unlock them to play them on their own, and I found them far too easy to be entertaining for very long in that mode.

This game is fun, and it's always nice to have a game that you can play for short periods (as opposed to something like Zelda or Final Fantasy, which tends to be played for longer times at a sitting).

At some point I had conquered the world with just about every playable race, so going in expectations were extremely high for the next in the series.  After playing for a week, I want to give this 5 stars, because the game is a lot of fun, but bugs/issue make it impossible.

The city management system is very good, it's all about maintaining a balance between your treasury, your armory, peoples happiness, and food production.  For example if you want to build the a training ground that will let you train the most powerful troops, that building will also produce a large amount of squalor that will make your people unhappy (and thus likely to revolt).  Space in the cities is limited, so I found myself constantly tinkering with my cities to maintain the strongest military closest to the front while using my inner cities to supply the food/supplies to fight.

The armies while handled different from Rome 1, I've also come to like.  Building provide garrisons (based on type) to protect the city, armies have to have a general in them, and the number of generals is limited by the amount of land you've conquered.  This seemed to make the army management much easier to work with, instead of trying to manage tons of towns and generals, you just seem really need to manage the generals.  Recruitment and replenishment seems much easier as well compared to the prior Rome.  I do miss the dynastic feeling of having all the generals come from you family, but I like how units that are together a long time can gain unit traditions (abilities) separate from the Generals who lead them.

The battles are fun but a little frustrating.  Maybe it's because I've only played as Rome so far, but the enemy really seems to break way to easily.  As long as you are using basic tactics such as protecting your artillery and not allowing the enemy to out flank you, you should win most battles unless you are hideously outnumbered.  Calvary really serves no purpose that I've found besides running down enemy archers once the armies are engaged, and in most of the battles I've fought the computer AI seems to never use calvary themselves.  A couple times I tried to wheel my horse in behind enemy lines, but the enemy units would break/flee before they could even get in position. Naval battle I didn't get at all, and after some rather odd outcomes just resorted to auto resolve to complete them.  Still there is something satisfying about a good siege battle, or crushing a massive enemy force in the forests of Europe that kept be playing.

Now for the problems, which I would basically sum up in two ways, bugs and AI.

First for bugs, the game has a tendency to crash.  Can't say it happens all the time, but I'd say in the 15-20 hours I've played I've seen it happen at least 6-7 times.  Really annoying was in the middle of one battle the game would crash at around the same time continuously (3 times in a row).  Another bug I saw a lot was on the diplomacy screen, sometimes the buttons would all be greyed out, including the option to exit the diplomacy screen.  The only way to resolve it was to basically force the game to close and reload.  I got into the habit of saving before trying diplomacy.  Finally and I don't know if this is a bug or just a performance issue, but the load times and times between turns is excessively long.  I have a year old computer that met or exceeded all the requirements on this game so I don't think that is the issue.  It was not uncommon to wait several minuets between turns, I would suggest turning off the computer movements to help with this.

Now the AI, which seems..... questionable.  I understand thatin a game like this where there is a lot going on, occasionally you'll see odd things but finding repeated odd behavior is frustrating.  The AI diplomacy decisions seem completely random, and the treaties they offer you are almost always ridiculous.  Several long time allies would just decide to cancel all treaties with me for no reason I could determine, I wasn't attacking their allies or helping their enemies, they just got bored I guess.  They wouldn't attack, just randomly cancel trade treaties.  Another issue I saw was sieges from sea units, twice I saw a vastly inferior force lay siege to a city, and then basically both sides would do nothing.  Carthage was under siege for something like 15 turns before I got sick of waiting and just used my army to kick out the attacking army so I could conquer the city.  The naval force that had been holding the city, which included a large naval garrison, under seige was two ships.  The same thing happened later on the African coast where one Egyptian naval unit besieged a city for 25+ turns until I finally kicked them out and attacked the city myself.

Despite the bugs and problems I'm still really enjoying the game, with a few minor fixes I think this can be equal or even exceed the original.  For the price, you would hope it would come that way out of the box, but I still wouldn't have any reservations about recommending this game to friends, especially if the liked the first one.",Good Game With the Potential to be Great,1378771200,3,{'Platform:': ' PC'},
77580,4.0,False,"03 22, 2006",AAY4CI53G2LM7,B000CQ75VY,just me,"After playing the amazing movie-like experience that is Onimusha III, I must say THIS game is definitely not stunning enough to be a game that goes down in history. But, this new addition to the demon-slashing series is definitely good enough to maximize game-play experience for every player.

This title depicts an ancient Japan heavily infested with demonic energy, and it is up to a young man, Soki, to save the people. The story is not exceptionally unique, but it can engage the player enough to make him/her sit in front of the PS2 for several hours.

While playing the game, you'd realize that you are keeping your fingers really busy. As the player advances in the story, the character acquire new skills with a ""point-adding"" system, in which the player acquire points by fighting the Genma soldiers, which are found almost everywhere, and other different monsters in specific encounters. Making use of almost every single button on the controller to make different combinations will allow the character in the game to perform various attack styles and skills. It is all up to the player's preference on what skill to upgrade, what skill to use and when to use it. Also, with the ability to use two players at a time, one being controlled by the player and the accompanying one follows the orders of the controlled character, and to change the accompanying fighter at save points, the player finds himself making use of each character's unique abilities to solve various puzzles and gain access to areas certain characters are unable to reach. Strategy plays an important part in the whole game. It is all up to the player to utilize the various ways to get around each scenario.

The game allows the player to re-access the areas they've been to, to obtain any items they had missed out during the actual mission and to use a different character to gain access to a secret area to obtain item(s). As certain characters are only available after the player goes way into the story, this feature of allowing the player to revisit the places, makes sure nothing is missed. Most maps are explorable and the player should make it a point to revisit the places more than once in order to gain all available items. During a ""revisit"", the player can challenge a mini-game known as the Test of Valor again, regardless of whether they passed or failed in the initial mission, in which the character must defeat the stated number of enemies within a certain time limit. Each Test is graded with a Gold, Silver or Bronze medal, in which each grade signifies the quality of the item the player will receive after each attempt. A Fail does not award the character with anything.

The animation and graphics in the game can be considered brilliant, marked improvement can be seen from the previous titles in the series. All character and camera movement is smooth and synchronizes perfectly with the player's intention. Cut-scenes are beautifully rendered and as usual, the superb Voice Acting just goes on to prove that all the cut-scenes are wonderfully crafted. However, during normal dialogue where there is no voice-over, the movements of the speaking character are actually programmed in a loop. For example, if the dialogue's mood is angry, the character will perform actions in the ""angry loop"", if the dialogue's mood is normal, the character will perform actions in the ""normal loop"". The character's actions will repeat after one round, and it doesn't fit with the words in the dialogue box. Sometimes, the character movements are too exaggerated and seems a bit unnatural and unreal. For example, when Soki's dialogue shows that he's angry, Soki seems to be shivering too much with rage.

The music does not really fit with the time-line of the game's story, but it fits the game ambience totally. Traditional music instruments are used sometimes to combine with the pop/rock music in the arrangement. With this kind of arrangement, the music cannot fit with the story's time-line, and only serves as a simply ""fit-with-the-player'' music. The music will be good enough to the target market, which are the teenage gamers, as the rock/pop music is what these people of this age group are fairly interested in. However, as perfect as milk goes well with cereal, the rock/pop -style music fits with the game ambience perfectly.

Although there may be some weak points in certain areas, this game is still worth-playing, and with an open-mind, a player can be totally immersed with the game. It is undoubtedly another great addition to the series. The future still looks bright for upcoming Onimusha titles. I hope they hire some Hollywood talent on the next project, to set it at the calibur it deserves to be.","Great gameplay, falls down in the story department",1142985600,9,,

The characters end up acting like relatively believable people (with alteration for humor here and there, once or twice bordering on annoying depending on your taste), the only problem is that they largely start out in medias res and if you focus too much on why it can detract from the game. Some more build to clarify why they're doing what they are around their introduction would have been nice, but since everything else seems to work it's not a big problem.
Story: 7.6/10

The textures are relatively good and there's a lot of motion as you might expect for a clockwork/steampunk setting, but so much of it is muddy that it's often hard to separate the background from the active space. Fortunately the menus and text is fairly clear and once you understand how the paths are it is consistent enough for easy navigation.
Graphics: 6.5/10

There wasn't a large variety of sounds, but the clacking of distant gears and snarl of gunfire all seemed very appropriate, drawing attention back to what's going on. Voice acting was also fitting (though sometimes I thought they tried too hard to make certain spots funny). You can independently adjust the volume for voicing, effects, or music according to your taste, muting them if you desire.

Resonance of Fate - or End of Eternity in its Japanese title - is a lot of fun, but it has a steep learning curve and doesnt always do a good job of directing you to your next mission, partly because of the somewhat awkward overworld map. Customizing guns is something that can be slightly difficult if you don't pay careful attention to the tutorial. Fortunately, all tutorials can be accessed at any point later. Once you get a hold of the combat system its robust and a lot of fun (provided you don't have targeting issues).
Design and Gameplay: 7.9/10

Normally I would include camera and targeting under gameplay, but the issues here are repeated enough that I thought it warranted special note. In most games, the enemies are supposed to be the main opponent, but here it seemed like at least a third of the battles were more fighting with the camera and trying to get the lock-on to switch from one target to the next one you actually want to shoot instead of some random guy far away.
Camera/Targeting: 4/10

After you finish the story missions, you're given the option of going back to right before the final dungeon or starting the game over - either at a higher difficulty without your previous gear, or the same one and keeping all of your bezels, money, and items.
Replayability: 8/10

Resonance of Fate is not without its drawbacks, but as tactical/action game it can deliver a very enjoyable experience. The New Game Plus feature allows you to play as casually as you please and keep your gains for as long as you want to blast monsters with amusingly customized guns.

To get to the point quickly; SVR09 is an average wrestling game at the very worst and the only installment in the series I bother with that doesn't allow you to use the old school controls from HCTP thru SVR07.  For some reason I dislike 08 and 10 a lot but find myself loading this one up from time to time.

My biggest joy in this game is the addition of ""signature moves"" which you get when you store finishers.  It's very satisfying to do the Orton stomp and then prepare for a hunting RKO.  I also want to note I think the cut scene-type angles for finishers is better than most of the other games in the series; I hated it in HCTP and SVR06 for example, but also liked it in 05 and 07 (they seem to like to tweak this just enough each year to be different, which I guess is good and bad...).

The graphics in the game are average for a last generation ps2 game.  At this point in time the system was basically maxxed out so any title in the series after SVR07 basically looks the same - which is more than ok in my opinion since I happy to like the general appearances of the models.  Even the CAW's are great looking for the most part.

Speaking of CAW's; a lot of fuss is made regarding the attribute points for them in this game and how annoying it is set up.  The solution for this is really simple - shell out a few dollars for a max drive and download save files you find online.  Almost every creator who bothers sharing their save has made it a point to either hack or build up each CAW's attributes to a somewhat ""accurate"" level.  All of my CAW's have at least an overall 85 rating and I didn't play a single one of them in career mode to do so.  So there's your simple solution to that small issue.

The gameplay is solid and very much like a wrestling sim, a feature common in every title beyond svr07 so if you like the arcade-type gameplay better you may wish to stick with titles ranging from SYM thru SVR06.  My big gripe with the gameplay is having to dedicate two directions, right and left, entirely to an ultimate control move.  I don't see why it was really necessary and for a player like me who doesn't necessarily like these UCM's it's a waste of a category where I could have had 4 other preset moves.  I'm sure some players are on the opposite end and love it though, so for them this is probably a plus.  I'm not sure off the top of my head but I believe it was setup the same in SVR08 (but I haven't played that one in quite a while...).

Load times have been improved dramatically over 07 and 08 and will be noticeable to any player who has owned & played either of those 2 previous titles.  Big appreciation for this (thank god).

Overall it's a great game, the controls are very fluent if you give them a chance; I favor control type B personally since I like controlling my wrestler via the D-pad but to each their own.  I would have liked to have had an option to use the layout from 06 or 07 (probably 07 since it included the UCM's for the first time that year).

It's a solid game, as I stated in the title of my review.  I'll only give it an 8/10 as opposed to a 9 or 10 due to the fact it was late in the series and the playstation 2's era in general.  Things are a bit too familiar from the previous year or two's titles so if you own 07 and/or 08 and ARE NOT a big wrestling fan (just a fighter fan in general) you can probably skip on this.  However, it's obviously a must own for any fan of wrestling - even if you hate the new school, PG-era WWE offers now.

I have not played a wwe game since svr 2007. Every year the game would have too many faults which prohibited me from purchasing it. But I am finally ready to replace my ps2 game of Fire pro wrestling returns for wwe 13.
There is just so much content, it is unlimited. I look forward to downloading created wrestlers from the 80s, and early 90s. I look forward to downloading awesome arenas like the original wrestlemania arena or wcw/nwo arena. I just look forward to having my own organization exactly the way I want despite a few glitches here and there.
The replay value is incredible. There are things I have always wanted in a wrestling game such as proper tag team entrances,wrestlers staying down for realistic lengths of time (long enough to do a high fly move at least), a general manager type career mode like svr 2006(but more in depth), and interesting additions such as the omg moments, catching finishers,and tons of unique ways to eliminate players in royal rumble .
The reason I wanted to sell the game was because the AI is so weak. The AI in Legend is 90% of the time a complete joke. But I was able to make matches much more challenging by giving the AI an advantage against me. Now I play Legend with the AI starting with 2-3 finishers. This gives the AI unpredictable momentum and they become a definite threat in quick/squash matches. I am now enjoying the game much more as the cpu has become a challenge. And if I want an even greater challenge, I'll give them unlimited finishes and a manager. The one thing I'm not looking forward to is the rank #1 gold trophy....yikes!
In Conclusion, I find the gameplay pretty smooth, and fun. Attitude mode is terrific. I rather play through history then watch all the pay per views and shows of that era. I read people complain about the weapons physics, but I did not find it distracting. If anything the rope physics need more work. I would give the game a 8/10.","Has it's faults, but a great game!",1352073600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I actually enjoyed playing this game except every quest was either in Kirkwall or on the wounded coast.  I liked all the characters especially Isabella and Varric.  This game was definitely fun.

Story: The story takes place during the blight at first.  Your character is running from the blight trying to escape it with his/her family.  After that is done you reach Kirkwall and you must gain access to the city and become a citizen.  This game is definitely political and adventure at the same time.  You meet a bunch of new characters and see and hear about some from DA: Origins as well.  You're constantly picking between the mages and templars in this game.  That is the main plot of this game, but it's entertaining.  Their is no really strong bosses in this game I guess maybe the dragon in ACT 3, but that was still easy. 4/4

Character development: This game focuses a lot on character development.  You're either friends or rivals with your companions.  If you make an decision regarding the political problems of the mages and templars you might piss off one companion and make another happy.  You can romance characters in this game and some of them can even move in with you lol.  This was definitely the bread and butter of the game for me. 3/3.

Artwork/graphics/character design:  This is where the game blew it.  Character designs were great especially the female characters :).  The artwork and graphics just wasn't a focus for Bioware I guess.  Everything look the same and the game froze on me 10 times during my whole duration of playing this game.  If the game didn't have every quest in 3 areas and kept using the same design I believe this would have been better.  1/3.

Overall,  I liked the game it just didn't feel perfect to me.  I felt like their was some polishing left to do on the game and I felt frustrated in that regard, but it was still a good RPG.  8/10.

136397,4.0,False,"04 6, 2015",A2012IDQU58KD,B0016B28WU,KALiverin,"Before this, I had never played a Call of Duty game. Because I was curious about the series (and because I've heard so much hate directed towards the series on the internet), I thought I'd give this one a try because a lot of people seem to believe that this one is the best in the series.

The truth is that I'm not into modern shooters as much as I am into older ones. I grew up playing games like Goldeneye, Doom and Wolfenstein 3D, so you already know where my perspective lies.

Call of Duty 4 obviously doesn't play like those games. The way it controls, the way you shoot enemies and even the way enemies engage you feels completely different. When I first played this, I couldn't let that go.

But after coming back to it with a refreshed attitude, I found the game pretty fun, but not without some things that still annoy me.

When I say refreshed attitude, that means that I simply tried to play the game for what it was instead of what it wasn't and I also tried to play to its strengths rather than its weaknesses.

I think the strength of Call of Duty 4 lies in the kinds of large scale firefights you get into throughout the game. I wouldn't say the game is deep, but you do have a bit of variety in how you approach situations. I didn't start having fun with the game until I found out how to approach battles in a way that makes me most comfortable. My preference in FPS games is to hang back and pick off enemies from a distance with a sniper rifle, and that's usually where I was having the most fun in this game. I would look for ranged weapons and replace my sidearm with it because the pistol is useless.

It's a lot of fun when a fight breaks out because you have to be careful how you approach the situation. I've heard people say that Call of Duty is nothing more than a mindless run and gun shooter and if this game is any indication, that just flat out isn't true. They might be talking about the online play, which I didn't try, but the single-player gameplay definitely isn't.

You do have to take cover often and you do have to find good vantage points to shoot from. Enemies have a tendency to gang up on you, so you'll be dead quickly if you run out in the open and fire mindlessly. Granted, the regenerating health does make getting shot somewhat pointless (this has always been my most hated mechanic in modern video games), but it also isn't a get out of jail free card.

The main problem I have with the single-player gameplay is that it's often way too chaotic. It's sometimes difficult to do anything in this game because you're going to be constantly assaulted by large waves of seemingly endless enemies. That means you have to stop and kill every single one of them before you can go on, and sometimes that takes forever. I get that it's a war game, but I'd rather have fewer enemies that actually use tactics against you than a giant mass of generic ones.

Finally, the game is way too short and doesn't have a lot of replay value. You can try the game on harder difficulties and collect intel. I tried to play on the hardest difficulty, but I quickly gave up because it seemed far more tedious than challenging. I'm also not a fan of shoehorned collectibles.

There's a storyline to the game, but I didn't find it interesting. It's just your typical military story, nothing special. It's not the game's strength, but the same can be said about most video games.

Overall, I enjoyed this game for what it is. The series has gotten massive amounts of hate over the years and I understand why. These are the most popular games out right now and consistently sell millions of copies. It has also spawned an incredibly obnoxious generation of 12 year old boys who have no self-control or self-awareness who refuse to play anything else but Call of Duty. I get it, but if the rest of the series is anything like this, I can't imagine that they're horrible abominations of games. This game is definitely not something with deep mechanics that requires a tactical approach, but it's also not entirely shallow.

I do prefer games with more tactical qualities that give you more choice in how to approach situations ( I seriously don't understand why games these days only allow you to carry two guns at a time), but I'm also someone that's flexible. I enjoyed this game simply for what it was and while I wouldn't suddenly call myself a fan of the series, I did have fun with it. The game is only a few hours long, which is a rip-off at full price if you prefer single-player games, but since I only payed a few dollars for this, I feel like I got my money's worth.","A pretty decent, fun game (single-player review only)",1428278400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

In the first one, you don't fully understand at first WHY you are an assassin, you just are. In this one, it's explained very clearly why you must become an assassin. You start off as an Ordinary Joe, and through several stages, your abilities are more fine-tuned, people either respect or fear you, based on your uniform... the open world environment is still present here as well. And perhaps I'm wrong in this, but the world seems BIGGER this time around. In the first one, you were sort of confined to a few cities, whereas in this one, you have a LOT of cities to choose from, as well as some mountains.

The graphics are good, just like the first one. The cutscenes really add a good sense of depth to the game, whereas the first game didn't really have that many cutscenes, and they were mainly only shown when the character came out of the Animus.

The voice acting is great! I felt really absorbed into the world as I just sat and listened to different characters, with different accents per part of the continent they were from, explain to Ezio what is happening.

The game itself is not TOO difficult, but there are some side-quests that are just annoying (one of them being the collection of the Codex Pages... THAT took me about a week to finish because I didn't know where all of them WERE, or how to find them). It seems like Ubisoft just threw in those kinds of missions to make the game seem longer than it really was, but all it did was aggravate the crap out of the player.

Overall, four stars seems adequate for this game. It's not perfect, but it's VERY close to being perfect.

This game does have a long single player campaign. You have cities that you have to defend. Each city is shaped like a circle with rings of defense. In each ring there are individual squares where you build each structure. You build structures like gatling guns, sniper guns, missle launchers, power plants, and housing for civilians. The point of civilians is to get taxes out of them to get more money to build more and better structures. You can also upgrade each structure up to at least level 10.
You get to choose which city and which enemies you want to fight to earn money, crytals, and advance in the story. After each level if you win you also get civiilians to move into the city. The better you did the more civilians and crystals which are used for certain structures. There are levels of enemy attacks from 1 on. The lower the easier and it is infinite the amount of times you can beat enemies so you can grind and level up your stuff as much as you want. Also there are bosses after you play a certain amount of enemies in a row. There are also leaders who give you special abilities like reduced cost of structures or superuattacks who you level up as well.
If you like tower defense or strategy I bet you will like this. It is a very deep game  FOR A TOWER DEFENSE GAME. You don't do anything but tower defense so if you don't like that then sure as hell DO NOT BUY THIS.
I did not give it 5 stars because it can get boring and repetitive so it is best in short bursts. Also the story is useless and the commanders for some reason are teenagers and is non sensical. They coulda made it better by making it older and more realistic commanders. Also 30$ is steep for any tower defense game even one as deep and long as this.

343926,4.0,True,"11 1, 2014",A2H9UO8RYFX5MB,B00I19TXQE,Rich Stoehr,"What you've read is true. Lurking in 'Alien: Isolation' is the best Alien game made to date. Even with its flaws, it's the game Alien fans have been waiting for.

It's a tall standard to live up to. Ridley Scott's original film 'Alien' set the bar for a creeping horror experience in a near-future science fiction setting, a bar which few films and no games since have met. 'Alien: Isolation' is the first game to pick up that torch and confidently carry it forward. Not only does the game faithfully, painstakingly re-create the atmosphere and mood of the film, it extends the experience to the interactive realm, so players can now explore and relive the dim hallways and dark, cramped ventilation shafts, the tactile computer keyboards and the glowing monochrome screens. Like the original film, in many ways, 'Alien: Isolation' is a beautiful game - filled with moments that are breathtaking in their way. Many times I found myself stopping to simply admire the way light filtered down a passageway or the deliberate composition of visual and audio elements that help to set the mood throughout the game.

And sometimes, stopping to admire the scenery was a mistake, because the ruthless Alien stalking me chose that moment to come after me again.

Make no mistake - for all its stark beauty, 'Alien: Isolation' rarely lets you forget that you are prey, trying desperately to survive the constant attacks of a deadly predator. The first hour or two of the game ease you into this idea - as Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen Ripley from the films, you are investigating a possible clue to your mother's disappearance in the form of an intercepted flight log recording. The quest brings you to Sevastopol station, a spaceport fallen into disrepair after it has been essentially abandoned. Evidence mounts that something is terribly wrong on the station - primitive androids are defying their programming to eliminate the few remaining humans, and those humans are suspicious and more likely to fight you than help you. The reason for all this becomes clear in short order - Sevastopol is now home to the same type of Alien that Ellen Ripley ran into on the Nostromo. And now, it's after you.

From this point forward, 'Alien: Isolation' becomes a tense, gripping, often terrifying sequence of hiding, sneaking, and squeezing your way by as the Alien stalks you. Let's be clear here - other than a very few select moments, the Alien's movements are not scripted and it can literally come from just about anywhere. And mostly, you'll hear it before you see it - moving around in the air ducts above you, clomping its feet on the floor behind you, sharp chuffs of breath as it tries to find you, a piercing screech when it sees you. Often, unless you're already hidden, if you can see it you're already done for. It can't be killed, but you have a motion tracker to help you ""see"" where it is (most of the time), you get a flamethrower to scare it off briefly (until you run out of fuel), and there are a few items you can make to help distract it (until it figures those are just distractions). But mostly, you're doing your level best to avoid it or hide from it, hoping it doesn't glance in your direction. In its randomness and cunning, the Alien doesn't feel like a computer program on a set path of decisions - it feels like another intelligence, and it's out to get you.

There are times when the Alien threat is minimized and it's a little safer. Along the way, you learn a little more about what happened to the station and how the Alien got on board, as well as getting extra hints from the Nostromo crew if you're persistent. Other humans and androids are threats too, and pose their own unique challenges, but it's the Alien that will have you running time and time again, right up to the end.  Which is where some of the game's flaws come in.

Without spoiling the ending, I can say that it felt like nobody was sure how to end this game. There are a few scenes of action that stand out because they don't really fit in with the tone of the rest of the game. The ending itself comes suddenly, and feels abrupt, recycled, and vaguely unsatisfying. For a game which makes its mark by building an impressive mood and tension, it sells itself a little short by failing to pay that tension off with a satisfying ending. There was a rich opportunity here to pay off the connection of Amanda and her mother, but I can't help but feel that opportunity was missed in the end.

In addition, there's a few odd glitches in the PS3 version that disturb the mood. Occasionally the audio, which is excellent overall, does not play or is poorly mixed. My favorite glitch, though, was when Amanda caught on fire because she stood next to an open flame...and stayed on fire until I went back to a previous save. In one case, she was even burning in space. It was both funny and annoying, but the real effect was that it reminded me I was playing a game.

For the most part, though, the PS3 version of the game is impressive both graphically and technically. I was deeply involved and engaged in the experience of 'Alien: Isolation' and that had a lot to do with how solidly and thoroughly it is built. Some cutscenes had some choppiness in them, and I can tell from watching videos of the PS4 version that the PS3 graphics are somewhat simplified...but while I was playing, I was enthralled and steeped in that world. Steam issuing from vents and strobing yellow lights and reflective textures along the walls and floors are rendered gorgeously. Props, too, for the sound design - the sounds of the ship are lovingly created in great detail, and add immensely to the atmosphere. The sounds of the Alien stalking you are just as effective, and unforgettable.

For most games, I tend to avoid downloadable content, but 'Alien: Isolation' makes it almost a must, especially for fans of the 1979 film. ""Crew Expendable"" and ""Last Survivor"" allow you to replay small parts of the movie (with some changes), featuring the original actors' voices and character models. For me, ""Last Survivor"" is the standout winner here - re-creating the last moments of Ellen Ripley's escape from the Nostromo in incredible, tense detail. It's short but sweet, taking only about 15 minutes to play... but what a 15 minutes!  The latest DLC, ""Corporate Lockdown,"" adds to the game's ""Survivor"" mode with new levels to play through, and adding a little bit to the story. Overall, the DLC for 'Alien: Isolation' adds to the experience in some substantive ways, and for me, they were well worth the price of admission.

Simply put, 'Alien: Isolation' is a lovingly, deliberately, confidently crafted experience. There are so many ways that this game elevates itself above most games - an intelligent and truly frightening nemesis, an emphasis on surviving rather than fighting, and a faithful re-creation of a much-beloved film. From it's beautiful visuals to its rich sound design to its undeniable atmosphere, this is a game that stays true to its roots.  It's also a game that takes chances, takes risks, and despite its occasional missteps, mostly hits just the right note.

I have to correct myself. This is not the game Alien fans have been waiting for. This is the game that has been waiting for Alien fans - crouched in a dark ventilation shaft, waiting patiently, poised for just the right moment to strike. That moment is now. Are you ready for it?

148963,4.0,False,"06 25, 2009",ALC6LWQXBHIPG,B000ZKBJXC,Dredded Deuce,"This is a game I just knew was going to suck. It's not that many games based on movies that do well and this licence has been sitting almost 20 years with little to no activity.  However I am really surprised at how well it plays! Even when I read awhile back that this would be the definitive 3rd movie (actually now there is talk that a 'real celluloid' movie coming) I wondered how they would pull this off. I must say that using the writing as well as voice talents of the Ghostbusters cast makes this a great game to get into. Any company that wants to use a movie licence to make a game really should take notes on how to create an immersive story.

Moving right along, I really love the fact that there is no HUD clogging up the screen with useless info, some really tight graphics and again great banter among the cast DURING the course of the game. Any of the reviews you probably read are already spot on. This game keeps you busy. You can upograde your proton pack, scan for ghosts to get nto your Spirit guide etc.

My only complain of course is that in the game you can't control your favorite Ghostbuster unless you play it in MP mode which also handles pretty well.

IN some places it feel repetitive because you are actually 'killing' some spirits as opposed to actually trapping them but part of the fun of course is some of the bigger bosses.

The set peices are also impressive and help for the immersion experience.

There are a few plotholes in the game which I won't give away which might spoil some people's fun but what I would recommend is watching the movies again and catch some stuff you may have missed or didn't get which will make this game all the more enjoyable!

 the sound is fantastic. I haven't even tried out the 5.1 surround yet but the regular stereo sounds great.

 the wireless transmitter has an auxiliary input so you can plug in pretty much any source to use these.

 they are very heavy for headphones and therefore are not that comfortable for very long sessions. I really start to notice them after a couple of hours.

 when you press any buttons on the headphones, there is an audible beep that is VERY LOUD in your ears. I wish this beep would match the volume setting, but it only seems to have one volume setting.

 they are a bit fiddly to set up initially, with different configurations of cables for different consoles/setups - but once they're set up, they are awesome.

Yep, the graphics suck, the players all look alike, some of the scenes are choppy, the crown are a bunch of cardboard cutouts, and the menus are weird.  I own a 360, so this is what I can get.
On the positive, I will say I am thankful for this.  It's NOT made by EA.  If the gameplay sucked bad as the newest Madden games, I'd buy a PS3 for just this one game.  Fortunately that is not the case!

We have a Great pitching engine, that is actually better than, ""The Show's.""  Base running, and stealing are fun, and the controls are easier to use than The Show as well in my humble opinion.  Do I wish I could have,  ""The Show,"" for X Box?  Yep.  Can I?  Nope.  I guess they don't want my money, so, I'll play this.

The graphics Are what's wrong with this game, but game play is fun.  Franchise mode, is fun.  The draft, free agency, keeping an eye on prospects from A - AAA is fun, and challenging.  Batting isn't easy, but it's not as hard as The Show either.  My stats every year are well within reason, as are those of my franchise team mates.  It's challenging, without being frustrating.

Fielding is easy to learn, but you can't be careless, and the pitching is more fun than any game there is.  You have to change locations, speed, and hit the corners if you want to win. I'll repeat;  I love that this game is it's challenging, not frustrating.  Oh I can turn it up to Legendary, if I want to, (Which I do in My Player), but in Franchise, I choose not to.

My player mode is a Blast.  I get hours of fun playing as myself, trying to make it to Cooperstown.  I've done it once as a fielder, not I'm trying as a pitcher.  It has been really fun, and a challenge.

I can edit playes, trade, do whatever I want with my rosters.  Like another reviewer said, I'm making the best out of a game that really for me, lacks graphics, not the fun factor.  My son and I play for hours, have a blast, as do my friends and I.  That's what a game is for.  Having some fun.  When it comes down to it, I don't really care if Clayton Kershaw's hair, face, and motion are perfect, I'd just like to try to hit him in a game, where I have a fighting chance.  That would be a video game.

I'd like to move a team, customize a stadium, hire and fire management, and yes, I really, really do wish it looked as cool as ""The Show,"" but it doesn't.  So, I'll sit in my favorite chair, look at some ugly players, but have a great time doing it.

There is a evil, huge mega corporation that use animals to test new human products. It just so happens that Spanxs the weasel,( who was experimented on with electricity, ) and Redford the rabbit ( who was experimented on with beauty products, ) are chained together and are about to become fused together for the rest of thier lives.

Woody,"First off, let me say, I experienced all the same problems as many others with bugginess and instability with Empire TW for a couple years, including a point where the game's entire campaign map was garbled pixelated mess. After I figured out that DISABLING CROSSFIRE fixed it, I was finally able to get into the meat & potatoes of the game.

Pros:
-Player controlled Naval Battles
-Gunpowder warfare
-Massive campaign map including 3 continents, and several ""trade seas""

Cons:
-Initial stability issues
-Lack of truly diversified units in each faction

Technical stuff:
-Obviously, the graphics problems that were rife with this game are a huge turnoff. They're correctable, but takes some technical know-how to find and disable the settings that make it fail.

Campaign Stuff:
-Campaign is massive, spanning North America, Europe/North Africa/Western Middle East, and India. There's ""trade seas"" where you can send trade fleets to establish overseas income, but you cannot establish cities or land armies, strictly naval units.
-Out lying communities develop into subsidiary towns of the regional center, that you can build 1 of 4 types of building on top of, increasing trade, religion, research or happiness. This makes raiding a possibility and local armies have to actively defend their whole region, not just bunker down in one city. A weak enemy can wreck the trade of a whole region without ever besieging a city through raids.

Battle Stuff:
-The biggest change is Naval Warfare is now player controllable, and far more diverse. Gone are the triremes of Rome TW, and they've been replaced with the massive 100 gun battleships-of-the-line of the old type British Navy. The battles introduce a new depth to TW, making the player learn how to use wind, the right type of shot (regular, chain, or grape) to take the enemy ships, and what mixture to compose a fleet out of.
-Land battles are less bouts of bloody hand to hand combat, but are mixtures of musket exchanges, artillery duels, chemical warfare, and melees. More advanced armies with good grape/shrapnel shots and puckle guns (early machine guns) can devastate their enemies infantry before sweeping the field.

The main issue I found with Empire TW was the lack of diverse units between factions. All factions essentially had the same ships, same infantry, cavalry and artillery, while in the earlier Rome TW, you had factional units, Carthage had war elephants, Britons had chariots, Rome had Legionaries etc etc.

When using this, it's different then setting up a ps4 controller as this one uses a Bluetooth usb dongle that plugs into the port.  The part that I think is causing the confusion is when initially pairing the guitar with the console you press and hold the sync button until the red lights flash fast, cause if you just press it once they flash slow, and this will not pair the guitar.

The other hardware issue that a lot say is the guitar loses its pairing after putting ps4 in rest mode.  This is easily avoidable by going into power save settings on the ps4 and unchecking the box keep applications suspended.

For the game play I'm mostly satisfied, I really enjoy the new guitar layout and the game is very fun to play when taking a break from aaa titles.  The online play is a very welcome concept as I like being able to play random songs.

As such, it's closer to an adventure game than survival-horror, but it still packs a punch.

""Silent Hill: Shattered Memories"" preserves the main story concept from Silent Hill's first game: You are Harry Mason, trapped in the town of Silent Hill looking for your daughter Cheryl. However, while the original was about defeating monsters and solving puzzles, this game  is based on differing story paths based on the player's choices and actions. Some of these choices are more obvious - for example, the game begins with a psychological survey. Others, like where your eyes focus during certain scenes, are more subtly recorded. Like in Silent Hill 2, every action - even out of cutscenes - can potentially alter the course of events; this isn't limited to the development of the plot, but also things like the appearance and behavior of certain characters.

The game is divided up into three major game modes: ""cutscene"", ""exploration"", and ""escape"". Cutscenes in this game are for the most part semi-interactive. You can look around, fiddle with things, and so on during cutscenes. In some cases, the Wiimote will be used to agree/disagree by ""nodding"" or ""shaking"" your field of vision. Some factors, like where your eyes look during cutscenes, are not explicitly noted by the game, but are registered nonetheless. The trick is figuring out what the game ""cares"" about and what it doesn't - but the process of discovery is interesting in its own right.

Exploration scenes make up the majority of the game. Unlike in previous games, there is no combat, so exploration consists largely of trying to find keys and so on. The only ""encounters"" are ghostly images and messages that the player can discover, which are fairly unsettling, but it lacks the oppressive atmosphere of previous Silent Hill games. Until I realized this, it had a lot more potential for scary stuff, but the only combat-like portions are put into very identifiable sections: the ""escape"" sections. In Escape scenes, Harry has to run from monsters; it's fast-paced and more about evasion than defeating enemies. Usable doors are marked with a teal glow, though they may not be the ""right"" route or the ""best"" route. Some interactive environmental pieces will slow down enemies or can be used to evade them, like lockers (can be hidden in) or windows (can be jumped through). These scenes are fast-paced enough to be disconcerting, but the way they're ""sectioned off"" means that the tension in general is sort of weird. Rather than being something that can happen anytime, these sequences are very distinct and reflect a major gameplay change. This negatively affects the atmosphere of paranoia the game tries to foster.

Essentially, the most interesting part of the game is how choices affect gameplay. The actual branching paths may be relatively limited, but you do get a sense of ""the way you choose"" actually determining what happens. It's a game where the player is constantly being judged, even if they don't know what for. If choices are made honestly, the game says something about the player, too. It's not just the usual ""pick dialogue options"" set-up; occasionally, there will be an activity like coloring a house or hearing a story and determining who the ""guilty"" party is. It's a neat attempt to actually explore different methods of interaction.

The graphics aren't great, but the animation is smooth and fluid. The environments don't feel as scary as previous Silent Hill games, but this is most likely because the blood and rust theme of previous games is replaced by a snow-and-ice theme. The interface is pretty good, especially since Harry's phone serves as the primary menu system.

Overall, Shattered Memories is a good addition to the Silent Hill series while being radically different, gameplay-wise, than the other games. It's not quite as expansive as it could be, but it definitely feels like your choices and actions have consequences. For this reason alone, it's worth trying out.

This one is definitely recommended if you are a die hard FF fan or just getting into it.

The story is solid and focuses on the main protagonist, a somewhat annoying, but kind of in a Luke Skywalker kind of way, kid named Tidus.  Ripped from his home in Zanarkand, he is thrown forward a 1,000 years into the future where a creature aptly named Sin wanders around the oceans and destroys civilizations periodically with what seems to be minimal effort.  He is guided to find several individuals that soon become a family unit in order to fight and finally defeat Sin.

The gameplay and controls are very typical of the FF genre, with turn-based fighting.  However, the game reinvents travel through the landscapes by making it rather linear.  Instead of wandering around a castle for ten years trying to find stuff, the expansive maps are broken down into sections with interesting new locations and scapes to see.  The developers also reinvented leveling up.  Instead of just automatically getting denominations of points given to your character you are in full control of what each character receives using a Sphere Grid.  In essence, each time your characters level up, you are given a space to move forward on this map of spheres.  You use power spheres, mana spheres, etc. to fill blanks in the map and to give your characters points towards that attribute.  This is also how you learn abilities, with ability spheres of course!  This becomes super fun when you can break into other characters' map sections and learn their abilities as well.  It makes for more customization in characters that, with some effort, are incredibly strong.

That being said, the nearly impossible to get ultimate weapons for each character isn't really needed.  With highly customized weapons, aeons (the fancy word for summons in this game), and the Sphere Map at your disposal it becomes an easy game to win.  This, and mainly only this, reduces the star count.  It was EASY to beat.  My 99+ hour regime of playing FFs must be at an end with FFVIII.

Unlike FFIX, this game is quite unique and doesn't follow in the footsteps of other FF by stealing their music and plotlines.  It's more surreal and metaphorical than past games and the music is pleasantly enjoyable, as usual, thanks to Nobou Uematsu.  Even the card game that was very typical of FFs of the past is left behind.  Instead, a sport called Blitzball replaces the card game and is thoroughly enjoyable once you figure out the dynamics.

I however decided to dedicate a SoftTH profile to this splendid game from Activision and run it across all 3 of my displays at once! SoftTH is one of the coolest PC programs ever made, and when using the Widescreen Fixer (another free program) to correct the field of view in Transformers WFC, the game looks awesome output on my tri-display which is one 40"" Sharp 3DTV in landscape mode for the center display, and two 24"" LCD Monitors attached to either sides of the 40"" TV in portrait mode for a combined resolution of 3648 x 1152! SoftTH takes ANY monitor setup, any configuration and uses a logic calculator to appropriately stretch ANY game across the displays... It is free, make sure you also download both Widescreen Fixer and Flawless Widescreen as these can help with field of view and menu errors. :'D

The game itself is very well done, the physics, targeting and cut scenes are a pleasure to experience, just don't expect to find ANYTHING human or organic, cause the whole game takes place on Cybertron and there is no green there at all.  :p",Splendid game,1402012800,,,

**First and foremost, THIS IS AN ADULT GAME, NOT INTENDED FOR CHILDREN.**

Storyline:  The original Inferno is basically a guided tour through the nine circles of Hell itself.  Dante tells the story of his journey, what he sees, and who he encounters in each circle.  While this makes level design a breeze, and could make an excellent movie, video games require more interaction, so some tweaks are needed.  The end result is that the poet Dante has been replaced by the crusader Dante, a skilled and powerful knight who has stitched a red cloth cross onto his chest.  While this is a far cry from the reality of the man, he makes for an amusing character and it certainly makes for better game play.  The overall storyline is a pretty typical rescue the damsel in distress scenario, though Hell makes for a unique setting.  The literary purists out there will not be thrilled with the changes made, but from a gameplay standpoint, they are fairly necessary.  The developers could have approached it a bit differently, by naming the main characters something else and having them explore Dante's vision of Hell, perhaps with Dante as the guide.  Personally, though, I'm not enough of a literary purist to be bothered by this.

Gameplay / Mechanics:  Anyone that has played God of War will be familiar with the gameplay mechanics of this game.  Personally, I don't think that's a bad thing.  The combat is smooth and familiar, and you can pick it up and start playing right away, without having to familiarize yourself with a new system.  Leveling is actually improved here, in my opinion.  You have two paths of abilities to upgrade, holy and unholy.  Both paths have different levels of abilities, which are advanced by punishing or absolving enemies of their sins.  As you fight your way through the level, you will earn souls to purchase new abilities.  The advantage here is that you get to pick specifically which abilities you want to unlock or upgrade, rather than simply which weapon.  You also meet and get to judge some famous historical and mythological characters, and pass judgment on their sins, which certainly adds an interesting element to the overall theme of the game.

The gameplay mechanics are not quite perfect, however.  I was disappointed by some of the mini games.  In order to use a health fountain, you are required to button mash O.  Many of the absolution finishes and some of the punish finishes require the same.  If you were bothered by the tank and helicopter mini games in Prototype, this will annoy you.  It's not a huge problem, but it feels unnecessary.  After all, there's not even really any skill involved in simply mashing a button repeatedly.

Graphics/Artwork:  This is one of the areas in which this game truly shines.  It is amazingly conceived and detailed, and while beautiful might be the wrong word considering the subject matter, you will quickly find yourself immersed in the hell swirling around you.  The levels and the enemies are minutely detailed and stunning to behold.  The artwork and the world that is created here definitely adds a lot to gameplay.  Unfortunately, I'm not a big fan of some of the cut-scenes, many of which feature old school animation, and frankly feel like a plug for the Dante's Inferno movies that they released alongside the game.

The bottom line to this game is simple.  If you like God of War style gameplay, you aren't going to be offended by the subject matter, and you're not a literary purist, buy this game.  It's not for kids, and it isn't strictly true to the Inferno storyline or Dante the man, but it is definitely a fun, enjoyable game, and it does take you Inferno's nine circles of hell, which makes for quite the trip.",Hell Yes!,1265760000,14,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

I read some of the other reviews below and heard about how this game isn't compatible with some graphics cards or whatever. If that were the case, I'd haved to give this game one star. But since this game did run perfectly well on my machine, here's what I have to say about it. The only space sim that I've played other than Tachyon is X-Wing--an old VGA game--but in many ways X-Wing was the turning point in space sims. The graphics in Tachyon are really good, if somewhat redundant. What I mean is that sometimes I see the same patterns and textures on space stations. Speaking of space stations, I was MOST IMPRESSED by their SIZE. The people at Novalogic really did an outstanding job at scaling things correctly. But what really got me to buy this game was the fact that you could buy different ships and decide what armament and upgrades you want to put on it. Certain ships have a certain amount of slots, and the possible combinations are nearly endless. Another nice feature is that you can own multiple ships at once, or sell individual ships or parts for money. You can hire wingmen to assist you on missions. Since there is no in-flight camera, it's hard to tell if your wingmen did anything to help you, but at least they don't die easily--even the poorer pilots. There are several external view, but I didn't find them very helpful. They should have put a gunsight on the external view so that you could fly through the mission, accomplish it, and enjoy the scenery at the same time. The game is sorta nonlinear. You get to choose which level mission you want to undertake, but ultimately you will end up doing the others. The missions are fairly simple and varied, which is nice. I remember that X-Wing was downright frustrating at times. By the way, there are cheats for this game, so if you get stuck, look 'em up. The levels with the fog are interesting, although they can be a strain on the eyes and disorientating at times. But that's not until the end. There are some cut-scenes, but nothing truly original or amazing--they're still the in-game graphics. This game could have been better, but overall I'd say it's worth its price. But I'd check to make sure it can run on your machine, first.",AN EXCELLENT SPACE SIMULATION,985478400,7,,

When I first heard about Titanfall I was hopeful, but remained cautious.  When I got to play the Beta a few weeks back my hopes were lifted.  Now after several hours of playtime I've got to say this game is certainly worth the hype.  I've not enjoyed myself this much playing a shooter in years.  Even matches that don't go my way, or matches that I downright suck at I still find myself having a blast.

The game is very fast paced.  At no time do I find myself wishing there were more players in the match.  6vs6 is the perfect balance for this game, and I'm sure most anyone who has actually played the game would agree.  Sure the bots aren't very intelligent, but it still feels great to wipe them out.  The graphics are great, I could care less about the whole resolution thing, bottom line is that for a fast paced shooter it looks amazing.  In the end the most important thing for any game is the fun factor and this game is downright FUN!  I highly recomend it to any gamer, shooter fan or not.

***Update***  So I've had the game about a month now and thought I'd give a quick update.  While I'm still playing and still for the most part having a lot of fun I felt I needed to drop my 5 star score down to 4.

This game was nice and the puzzles blended decently so you didn't feel like you were just doing puzzles to get somewhere. I do agree that there were a lot of puzzles - and they're logic puzzles so I used a walkthrough and the hint system for most of the puzzles, but still they were kinda realistic for keeping things safe. As I did the puzzles and went through the game, I still kept in mind the story and the task at hand and why Nancy was there, and the puzzles didn't distract that thought either. The only thing I didn't like was that when you're making food, it's another puzzle- I preferred actually making food like in the past games. This food puzzle reminded me of the food game in the game where Nancy goes to Japan, but luckily you don't have to do the food puzzle, so it worked out.

Malone,"I haven't finished the game yet, but so far it's proving itself to be every bit as fun and engrossing as I'd hoped it would be ever since they unveiled it two years ago. This game's take on Chicago is up there with the last two GTAs' doppelgangers of NYC and Los Angeles. The city is usually teeming with life and things to do. I'm finding it quite difficult to make progress through the story line, because there is a constant stream of side activities popping up at all times, and generally speaking it's all fun. There was a lot of fear that this game would be a ""typical Ubisoft game"" i.e. the same handful of mini-missions and mini-games being repeated over and over and over. To some degree that's true, but there's a lot more than a handful so it takes a very long time for any sense of repetition to set in. Personally I'm not interested in the ""multiplayer"" aspect of other players randomly invading my game to ""hack"" me, but it's only happened a few times and I don't mind it so much. I believe the more you opt to invade other players' games, the more often you will be selected to be a target for other players. I think I've gotten myself on the ""no fly"" list.

I was disappointed last March when the ""Story Trailer"" was released and made it very clear that the game wouldn't be living up to the graphical splendor of the first demo footage shown at E3 2012. I'm happy to find that the finished product comes reasonably close. Digital Foundry's analysis has shown that, at least for now, the PS4 version is superior to the PC version in some ways, which is incredibly surprising. That's very good to know as someone who basically had to turn in their ""PC gamer"" membership card years ago (the last time I upgraded my machine was to get ready for Doom 3 and Half Life 2, yipes.) This game generally looks great. I haven't seen anything as wonky as was indicated by the trailer in March.

Now that the game is out, it's no secret that a lot of people think the driving is terrible. I tried to be optimistic about it- one of the biggest and most common complaints about GTA 4 was its ""horrible driving,"" which I eventually found to be the most sublime driving in any video game in history (including GTA 5)- but no, unfortunately the driving in Watch Dogs is just plain bad. Sloppy. Stiff and unresponsive. Worse than the driving in any Saints Row or Sleeping Dogs. It only took me a couple of hours to go from ""My god, this is virtually unplayable"" to ""Eh, I can work with this I suppose,"" and I'm sure I'll be pretty comfortable with it by the time I finish the game. The development team leader has said publicly something like ""We worked very hard on the driving, we took all of the time and effort necessary to make it as good as it could be. We think we really nailed it."" Puh-lease. Ubisoft, you really need to do your homework for the inevitable sequel... which I'm sure is already in development. Back to the drawing board, s'il vous plait.

EDIT a few days later: Another note on the driving issue- As you progress through the game, you gradually gain access to more and more cars. There's a wide variety in how they handle, with the sports and ""performance"" cars naturally being better than the others. Paired with getting better with practice, the lousy driving does become a bit of a non-issue after a while. Still would like to see a lot of improvement in future WD games.

Console is excellent, snappy and fun to multitask between applications. The faster performance makes it a more enjoyable media machine with excellent Bluray capabilities and essential TV apps like Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Video. The controller is an amazing improvement over the previous Dual Shock. It might be the best controller ever made, even edging out the 360 controller. PS4 was a long time coming, but it truly makes gaming and media much faster and easier.

Bad:

Battlefield 4 is kind of poop right now. Single player is garbage and boring. Multiplayer is broken. EA shipped BF4 before it was done, as some reports online are suggesting. It's hard to respect EA as they've done a marvelous job of buying companies and ruining their franchises. (See: Bioware). Will be trading it in.

System runs toasty, has me concerned for the warmer summer months. Some bugs and hiccups in applications. Have had to hard reset the machine a couple times. A recent update came out, which i'm assuming patches a lot of that.

Controller battery doing go nearly as long as the previous dual shock, which can be disappointing for long gaming session. Luckily it doesn't pull an Xbox move and use AA's. It has it's own internal battery that can be charged via a system cable.

PS+ now required for online play.

Lack of good launch titles

Conclusion: Must upgrade for Sony fans. A better gaming proposition over the Xbox One over the long term, with better exclusive franchises, and better graphics.

Sure you have weekly events but they are WEEKLY lol.

  I don't mean to judge the game too harshly as it does look good and plays very well, there is plenty to collect and customize but there isn't much meat on the bone when it comes to fun factor.  I find myself playing it maybe 1-2 hours per day/every other day just due to running out of stuff to do, buying the daily shop items might take 5-10 minutes but then all you do is collect stuff to sell/hoard for the rest of the time.

  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it does most things well and suits it's target demographic but I wish Nintendo would add a little bit more optional complexity, look at games such as Rune Factory for example, you have the basic content which is farming/raising monsters but you have a much deeper social element than just saying (how's it going) to 7 villages every day and you have cooking, blacksmithing, combat, etc.

  I know combat and blacksmithing don't belong in animal crossing but I was just making an assessment.

  If you haven't played animal crossing before and are interested just don't expect a game you can sit down and play for an extended session but if your on the casual side of the gaming spectrum this will be your new hobby, I would say I'm somewhere in the middle as there are days I don't play games at all but other days where I might play for 6 hours straight due to a rainy day or something.

  Another very good, similar game series is Harvest Moon and the aforementioned Rune Factory, both are very good and similar in overall quality albeit maybe a bit less polished as I have to admit, Animal Crossing just reeks of the sleek design Nintendo is known for, on the overall ""feel"" of the game it gets very high marks and I'd put it in the same tier as Mario Kart which is saying something!

From centuries old Egyptian curses, to a secret and lost tomb filled with mystery, Nancy Drew's latest adventure, Tomb of the Lost Queen, is most definitely worth a glance. HerInteractive is emphasizing this game as a new trademark to their series, mostly because it boasts a new user interface, and an improved screen resolution. So is the game worth a buy?

Storyline: 4 out of 5
The Good-
+The game's story was very exciting and much better than Trail of the Twister, (which has a similar story), in my opinion. One could most definitely tell that HeR improved as far as character development when playing through this game.

+Each of the characters in the game were very memorable and unique in their own way. Abdullah and Lilly were very interesting to talk to because they often had plenty to say about Egyptian factoids. Jimila and Dylan were also very humorous and interesting to interrogate, and I often couldn't wait to see what they had to say about various factors regarding the sabotaged accidents. It was also very interesting to see that Professor Hotchkiss is back, and it was very intriguing to give her periodic phone calls throughout the game. Professor Boyle was also a good phone a friend, but I found his voice to be somewhat monotone throughout each call which almost made it seem like he wasn't enthused about the tomb.

+Each of the characters in the game all really had secrets to hide, and I often found it very fun to interrogate them and see what they had to say. It made the game really fun to play, and I never felt bored.

+The characters in this game actually move around! Surprising, right!? Throughout the game, Nancy will have to manipulate and even lie to various characters to make them move to other locations while she does her snooping. Very clever, HeR!

+Usually, whenever cutscenes happen in a Nancy Drew game, it means that it's the end of the game and that the culprit is revealing themselves to Nancy. It is most DEFINITELY NOT THE CASE IN THIS GAME!! There are tons of moments in this game where there are cutscenes that make the player question if the game is finally over. (I had my doubts, of course!) I found the cutscenes to be really fun and very surprising. I'm really glad that HeR is also making the game more cinematic, since this game contained plenty of intriguing cutscenes to view. (Nancy's Prince of Persia moves, for example)

The Bad-

-Like most Nancy Drew games, this one doesn't really stray too far from the series as far as a plot line goes. Many of the usual plot points have been recycled here: a lost treasure, a mysterious curse, a string of sabotaged accidents, you name it. In my opinion, the so called CURSE, was added in as a last minute idea. I never really felt like a supernatural force was dooming everyone. And it didn't help that Nancy kept dismissing it as someone sabotaging the camp, since it took away from the idea that the curse may actually exist, which would spruce up the story's plot.

-The beginning of the game felt like something was missing. The opening introduction of Nancy's story regarding the missing team was cool, but then it suddenly jumps straight into the sandstorm and Professor Boyle getting attacked. What happened to getting introduced to the characters first?! Or at least getting settled into the camp for that matter. I really didn't feel bad (or any emotional tie) that Professor Boyle got attacked, and it really didn't make sense to just jump into the game that fast. The introduction wasn't bad, but it really could have been improved immensely. After all, the introduction is what makes the player WANT to know what happens next!

Gameplay: 4 out of 5
The Good-

+The new user interface in this game is FANTASTIC. HeR hit a home run with the new inventory screen and task list. It fits the game quite nicely and it just feels so natural to use.

+Nancy's cellphone was a great addition to the user interface, and I'm glad that HeR is emphasizing Nancy's move into this generation with the upgraded technology. I also like that although Nancy's camera didn't have any use in the game for tasks, it served as a great way to keep note of important murals as well as important books that we couldn't take with us. I just wish that her phone had a mini-game or something to pass the time when bored. (I purchased the game at retail and not pre order, and I really don't think it's fair to purchase a game with features that were taken out just for the people that ""pre-ordered""!

+While there's only two major places to go in the game, they are extremely in depth, most notably the tomb. At the beginning of the game, the tomb comes across as a disappointment, mostly because it feels so small. But as the game gets in about the middle, the tomb opens up into this HUGE maze of places to explore and plenty of mysterious puzzles to solve.

+The puzzles in the game are challenging, brain teasing, and fun! Some of them were pretty difficult, but nothing too impossible. The only one that really annoyed me the most was the tomb of Nefetari's children. Thank God for the Hint Hotline!

+The Hint Hot line is honestly, a godsend. Once Nancy has toyed with a puzzle for too long, the Hint Hotline actually shows the solution to the puzzle, which really made the game more fun, since the player doesn't have to seek an outside source for help. (Note: I didn't use any outside sources to beat the game)

+This game was surprisingly longer than other titles in the series. I would estimate approx 6-8 hours of gameplay here, and that's just Junior detective.

+The game at some points, has a glyph translating puzzle that players have to solve. Thankfully, HeR added a ""quick translate"" button, which really made the game much more enjoyable. After all, if Nancy can instantly translate some glyphs, why not all of them? Note: There's a glitch in the translating puzzle where the ""F"" button doesn't allow you to solve the puzzle in junior detective. In order to fix this, HeR has released a patch to solve the problem that you can download from their site. It doesn't hinder the gameplay by any means, mostly because players can just click on the ""Quick Translate"" button to skip the puzzle. Some people say that they'd rather solve the puzzle, but in my opinion, there's far more challenging puzzles to worry about than the translating ones.

The Bad-

-The game features that Nancy has to choose her options carefully as far as dialogue goes, but there really isn't any parts in the game that make that a factor. I was kind of disappointed and was really hoping for those kind of puzzles. However, I did notice that the dialogue is drastically different if Nancy chooses different responses during conversations, which I thought was cool.

-The game is littered with pictures of random people, yet they really don't serve any purpose in the game. I understand that HeR wants to put cameos of real life people in their games, but at least incorporate them in ways that make sense. Randomly placing pictures in Nancy's chest or putting them in the site grid book was unnecessary. (Unless HeR photoshopped a suspect into the picture, perhaps?)

-This is probably not going to happen until 5 years from now, but in my opinion, the point and click game play is getting old. Nancy Drew games need to be more 3D like, Myst 3: Exile, for example. Even if the game was a panorama, that would be an amazing graphical update. The user interface is great, but imagine Nancy Drew games where Nancy can look at the ceiling or at the floor seamlessly with the drag of a mouse.

Soundtrack: 4 out of 5
The Good:

+The soundtrack in TMB was very memorable and fun to listen to. Each of the songs had a mysterious tone to them, and none of them sounded like I was on ""vacation"" to Egypt, like some of the other Nancy Drew games had. Although I never really felt ""scared"" in this game, the music was very chilling to listen to sometimes.

+The sound effects in the game were very realistic and interesting to listen to. Some of them sounded like rehashed sounds from past Nancy Drew games, but I didn't mind it too much. I really liked how random rocks would fall in the tomb when Nancy was trying to solve a puzzle.
'The Bad:'
Nancy's options for ringtones/call tones all sound terrible! I miss George's Jazzy one from Alibi in Ashes, or even the Italian dance music from Captive Curse. Nancy also doesn't get phone calls from other players in the game anyways, but I still think it would've been nice to have those.

The voice overs for the suspects was very cool to listen to, although I found it kind of  awkward sometimes that suspects would randomly be friendly to Nancy when saying goodbye after yelling at her or clamming up to Nancy's questioning. In my opinion, this could easily be fixed if HeR made it so that the suspect dismissed Nancy without giving her the option to say goodbye. Then perhaps, it wouldn't be so awkward.

Conclusion: 4 out of 5
 Tomb of the Lost Queen is mostly definitely a huge overhaul in the series as far as quality goes. The gameplay was spot on, the graphic updates and new user interface is beautiful, and the ending tied loose ends very nicely. Unfortunately, it was ultimately the beginning of the game as well as a few random gameplay quirks that rendered the game one point off my scale. Let's hope Nancy Drew's next game can fix the story introductory problems like this one! With that said, I can proudly say that new novice players will have a good time with this game as well as veterans alike.",Tomb Worth Exploring?,1337385600,,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

The toggle on a PS3 is touchy to my mind and it goes all over the place before I can lock on to anything.  Why do I mention this?

Right now I have to fight the urge to go back and play more BL2 instead of finishing BLP-S, but I'm just on level 14 and maybe after playing it through a time or two I will like it better after getting used to the changes in play.

One change is that (at least through level 14) the slots very, very rarely pay off in ""moonstones"". In BL2, I would have won dozens of bars of eridium at the slots by level 14 while in BLP-S, I've won a grand total of 4 moonstones. On the other hand, there are a lot more moonstones scattered around the landscape than there was eridium in BL2, but there are also more things to spend Moonstones on (special tonics & the Grinder as well as the usual BL2 upgrades).

I find the Grinder to be disappointing. I don't see the point in feeding in 3 weapons to get one weapon of the next level (e.g. white to green, and you don't always get even that upgrade) which is usually no more powerful than any one of the weapons you fed in and worth only a fraction of the total value of the weapons fed in. Also, as in BL2, on subsequent replays you can pass your best, most powerful weapons along to new characters when you play a new game (via ""ClapTrap's Secret Stash"" or whatever they call it now). So on replays, this lessens even further the need to spend time and resources trying to get good weapons out of the Grinder.

But the Wii version is so different you might as well consider it a completely different game, thus you might as well buy both versions. I think the fact that it is so different is totally okay. As always with Nintendo, the visuals are more childish and goofy than the PS3-, XBOX360- and PC-versions. Graphics-wise this is clearly the Wii-game, so far, that has reminded me the most of Nintendo 64. It could actually pass for a N64-game. Perhaps graphics in videogames hasn't evolved that much the past 10 years after all? What I love about this game is that the graphics looks like it was meant for a 5 year old, and driving games like that usually have only fictional cars and no real/licensed ones. But this game sure has real/licensed cars. Among them Lamborghini Reventon, Bugatti Veyron and Pagani Zonda. Need I say more? The multiplayer is local only, and split-screen just like multiplayer used to be. You can play as the police but not to the same extent as in the PS3-, XBOX360- and PC-versions.

Conclusion: Not as good as the PS3-, XBOX360- and PC-versions but definitely worth half the price of the PS3-version (which is what it will cost you here at Amazon). I recommend the PS3-, XBOX360- and PC-versions for grown-ups, and the Wii-version for kids (of all ages:-)

Pros:

- Rock Band 1 drums works seemlessly with gh: wt
- Rock Band 1 guitar & mic works seemlessly with gh: wt as well
- Well polished gameplay with a great song list!  IMO better than rock band 2 b/c i am not a huge metal rock fan.  GHero has more titles like sublime, micheal jackson, eagles, no doubt.  A little more mainstream.

Cons:
- I truely dislike how if one band member fails out the whole band fails out.  When friends are over just having fun learning a new instrument this is very annoying that you can't ""save"" them like in rock band.

- I also dislike the way you have to trigger star power on drums( by hitting both center drum pads at the same time)  During the middle of a fast paced song on medium or hard this will certainly screw you up and I can almost never pull it off flawlessly)  Rock band again gets props for adding short fills and landing the the last note to trigger star power!

- not a huge fan of encores....after playing 4 longs songs i don't want an encore

Overall, feels very similar to rock band with slightly different animations and gameplay with all new songs.  Definitely has been working great and a good choice if you like the song list  however, if not I would stick with Rock Band 2...especially if you need a drum set.

UPDATE
After having the game for about 2 months along with RockBand 2 now.  I'd have to say that time and time again i go back to play RockBand 2 instead of GH:WT.  The reason is b/c i usually play when friends come over and we want the ability to play and pick from the most amount of songs.  Since RB2 allows you to play all your RB1 songs as well as your RB2 songs it truly has more than twice the number of songs than GH:WT.  Not to mention, RB2 has really polished how to search for songs to play...not only by song tile, artist, and difficulty but now you can search for songs by Genre and Decade as well.  Makes life very easy when your in the mood to play a paticular song.  While GW:WT is a fine game and works as advertised.  RockBand2 wins Round 1!!

The player uses both monsters in turn by selecting the desired character on a virtual gameboard, representative of the planet it is on, and moving it like a chess piece. Each space is a hexagon that represents playable, side-scrolling levels. There are rocky zones, jungle zones, city zones, and hyperspace zones. The hyperspace zones feature fights with Matango, Dogora, and Goten. The alien space ships resemble the design of Atragon and The War in Space.
Each board contains several monsters from the Godzilla series and some from other Toho movies and the objective is to clear each board of enemy monsters before advancing to the next board. Battles are fought when the player moves Godzilla or Mothra adjacent to an enemy monster, and are reminiscent of a match from a fighting game. The player plays a small side-scrolling level for each space advanced, and if one has moved adjacent to the monster, a battle follows the side-scrolling stages. More monsters appear on each stage until nearly every monster in the game is featured. When the player reaches Planet X, every previous monster is present along with King Ghidorah himself. The monster battles have a time limit of forty seconds but lack a countdown timer.

The care package itself is made from pretty stiff plastic so it seems like it's pretty durable. I use mine to store other video game related collectibles which is nice.

The quadrotor is pretty nice too. The previous BLOPS had the RC XD which looked like crap but this quadrotor looks and functions pretty well. I'm sure it cost them like $3 to make it but, from a collector standpoint, it's a very nice addition to anyones collection.

The coins, soundtrack and other goodies are so-so. I was expecting the limited edition camo to be pretty weak, and it was. And the soundtrack was just okay.

For a die hard fan, this set is almost a must have as its presentation and toys included within are pretty nice to have in your collection. From a gamer standpoint, it's not really all that much TBH. You'd probably be better off with the Hardened edition and foregoing the quadrotor/case. Overall, pretty fun game despite all the issues with it. Was it worth the $180? In retrospect, with the release of the personalization packs that recently came out, I think the $180 was a waste TBH.

Theisen,"Though the name doesn't explicitly mention it, this is actually the third game in the Ar Tonelico series, with installments 1 and 2 on the PS2. A good deal of effort seems to have been taken to make this game accessible to all players, however, regardless of any experience with the first two. This is extremely welcomed in a genre usually loaded long-running jokes, recycled battle systems and the like. There are a handful of references and loose NPC associations to the past games, but I want to be clear up-front in saying that most anyone could walk in here fresh and not feel at all disadvantaged. If some topics, terms and story elements do still end up confusing, data in the game 'Encyclopedia' can get people up to speed.

Standing out most to a lot of RPG players (and particularly those of Gust titles) will be the graphic and audio presentations. Exploration areas are in a tastefully rendered 3D, as well as all character movements in live scenes and battles. Textures and backgrounds are very obviously reused, but for a low-budget game I was impressed to see that at no point did an area feel truly dead or dull from past exposure. The soundtrack, as the series was already renowned for, is again top-notch and outdoes itself. An outstanding balance between familiar melodies and dynamic battle music has been found, which greatly enhances the music-based nature of the game universe and ""song magic"" driving combat. All this is above any beyond what one would typically expect within the genre.

In the review title I say ""well-polished"" in that, though by the sort of standard you might expect to see a top-rate action game, gameplay and combat are innovative and there's obvious attention to detail everywhere you might look. Combat is different this time-- a real-time 3D adventure-style battle system similar to Final Fantasy XIII-- instead of the typical JRPG turn-based affair. You're offered an interesting battle arrangement, with one song magic caster (one of the game heroines) and a vanguard of up to 3 to charge ahead. Players must match their attacks with certain beat rhythms in the battle music (far easier than it might sound, with a polite learning curve) and attack power varies on different notes. No two battles are every quite the same as a result, and that alone is an accomplishment.

The story concerned me for some time as being extremely shallow with excruciatingly boring characters, but after 20 or so hours in a very impressive depth comes to life, with honest-to-god unexpected plot twists, and a much higher level of development. A lot of this progression involves a series standard, the ""Dive"" system, which are essentially a series of short interactive narratives the protagonist goes through in the mind of each heroine. Though powers are enhanced by going deeper, there's an honest motivation just a simple desire to see what happens next. As it adds up to several hours of development with each characters, it's more than most games will hand you toward getting to know your comrades. Though not totally 100% required, even those finding it tedious should dig in a little, if only to gain some abilities like enhanced healing in combat.

Of course, not all is well and good in Ar Ciel. However much I dislike offering what looks like a rate-down on just one hinging point, that it is awkward aspects of combat makes it unavoidable. As mentioned, the ""diving"" above is not forced upon you, but neglecting will mean immense battle challenges later on. Each of the Ar Tonelico games have dealt with magic strength differently, but the process here is founded on an extremely convoluted and 'hardcore fan-friendly' game universe concept that female characters' magic exponentially becomes more powerful as they expose more skin... noting how they can ""absorb more energy"", but it's pretty obvious what the actual motivation is. To really power through, it does become progressively more necessary to 'strip' the heroines in battle.

Up to 4 tiers of magic can be summoned, but for better or worse each and every battle the players is forced to watch one of 4 personae of the heroines undress herself slowly and trigger it via a very awkward system of a button press + a shake of the controller (triggering its motion sensor). Getting the trigger can be extremely frustrating, painful, and sometimes battle-ending. It's a novel concept, but really something that needs a menu option to turn off. The end result is that, despite the catchy music and pattern variety to help, there's no truly ""easy"" way to get through combat, and for a bit of a asinine boon it becomes very easy to defeat all foes via casting with the built-up energy from undressing, making the other benefits to the party it gives such as healing or attack enhancements completely moot. A long gaming session may well give you a sore wrist, or at very least won't let you settle in and relax entirely.

Again, I hate basing so much negativity on that point, but if even I as a well-versed player of games in this series and genre overall find it a bit too far outside-the-box and as adding unnecessary levels of difficulty and pain, I'd venture to say that the majority of other players might get even more annoyed than I was. Usually a big problem like this would feel less tedious over time, but as battle becomes longer this becomes necessary multiple times each fight, it made the problem worse. By no means should this be taken as a huge flag against a purchase, but something of a warning at the very least.

In the end, you'll get 40+ hours of continuous plot evolution without any real need for 'EXP grinding' or backtracking. A limit on the number of random encounters in any one particular dungeon offers a proverbial light at the end of the tunnel for players just trying to get on with it. Normal difficulty set should suffice for most, though 'Easy' and 'Hard' are available to swap to at absolutely any time. Plot twists, plot branching, and multiple endings may well have you coming back for more, giving the game great replay value. With 8 different endings (5 of which take different directions), the game is even kind enough to allow players to begin with cleared ""New Game+"" data at specific points in the story where the more important decisions are made. At last, no more repeated 20-40 hour runs of replay for one measly scene!",This ambitious and well-polished JRPG has just a bit of a hollow core,1300579200,49,,

I only gave this 3 stars because it turns out I don't like real-time games as much as turn-based games. If you're like me and you don't like real-time games where everything moves super fast and you don't really have too much time to plan things out, then you won't like this that much, because you need to be quick on your feet!

I had no idea what Metal Gear was or what the series would become.  I just knew I had a new game and I wanted to play it.  This was my first introduction to the character Solid Snake and his world of infiltration and tactical espionage.
In Metal Gear you play as Solid Snake, a rookie to the Fox Hound branch of the military.  You are to infiltrate a jungle fortress called Outer Heaven and initially rescue Fox Hound members including one of the top operatives: Grey Fox.  While it is always great fun to fight and to shoot the guards, it is more effective to be able to sneak around them (this will be perfected in later Metal Gear games).  Stealth is important.  Shooting with a weapon not equipped with a silencer is a risky move.
As you progress through Outer Heaven you are sent on further missions and must fight ever more difficult bosses (tanks, men with machine guns, etc).  You begin the mission with nothing but your bare hands and a pack of cigarettes.  As you continue to play, you must acquire various weapons and items and use them to progress through the game.

Maybe they haven't witnessed those powers back in the 80's the arcades used to maintain. Nevertheless, Namco was one of the very few coompany that have still been a presence into the video market. While there have been classics like Donkey Kong, Centipede, and the legendary eater Pac Man, those classics keep coming back all over again. A few years ago, Namco made a compilation that was absolutely breathless, and now it has been restored.

Namco Museum 50th Anniversary Arcade collection for the Playstation 2, is a compilation of over a dozen of the most enjoyable classic video arcade games you could ever imagine. The collection maintains it worth in quarters. It includes some of the best from the past including Pac Man, Ms. Pac Man, Dig Dug, the classic aerial shooter Xevious, and the fast and sometimes furious Pole Position II. The menu also hits the mark quite graciously, by bringing some great classic pop songs of the 80's into the mix including She Drives Me Crazy by the Fine Young Cannibals, and the one-hit wonder Dexy's Midnight Runners classic Come On Eileen. The games remain just as infectious and exciting as they were back then, and have been restored and remastered quite beautifully. Although you don't get the specialized arrangement versions of Pac Man and Did Dug like you did from the previous edition, it doesn't take away any of the fun at all.

This nostalgia in a box, the Namco Museum 50th Anniversary Arcade Collection for teh Playstation 2, is a must have for older and younger gamers alike, who just care about the classics, without the expense of gobbling away money to the machines. I really do recommend this classic gameplay for anybody old or young alike.

The game provides three modes - a quick race for the patience challenged, time trials for fast challenges, and then the career mode. All tracks in the game are based on actual MotoGP tracks, and there are a good number of bikes to choose from.  You get to customize the bikes as you go, with numerous tweaks and decorative touches to add.

The bikes are, of course, the entire point of a motorcycle racing game. The detail and work they put into each bike is VERY impressive. You can really see the gleam on the paint curves and the worn creases of the leather. The tracks show an equal amount of work. For as many minute components that make up each large track, there are numerous small touches that you can see if you tool around at slow speed.

The game's training program helps you learn the basics - but even this area isn't ""easy"". To do the curves properly, you have to handle both the bike's steering and the rider's balance, just as in real life. My boyfriend and I have done a fair amount of long distance riding, so this sort of thing becomes second nature in real life. The game is helping you learn these same skills.

On to the actual racing. You can choose from the 2005 or 2006 season if you wish. You can do practice runs on a track before you qualify, which is really nice to help you learn it. The arrows which come up are both helpful and inobtrusive. If you bump another rider, they make an angry hand gesture at you, while you wave bye-bye to them.  Having the widescreen really helps see the course ahead and the riders you need to pass.

There are a number of flaws in the game. The loading screens take quite a long period of time to finish. There are occasional stutters in the game - not enough to cause trouble while playing, but it's noticeable. I wasn't overly fond of the music choices. In general, though, when you're zooming around the track at super high speed, focussing on getting that #1 spot on a hard difficulty, the things around you are a blur and all that matters is the quality of your bike. They really have done a great job with that.

These 3 games in their cartridge formats together can run about $80 or more. So needless to say I was very pleased that I saved $66 and still have a physical copy of the games on this psp umd, in case my psp ever broke down. (I'm not the biggest fan of downloadable games.) Aside from Phantasy Star the collection was a little bit disappointing to me. There are a lot of great 2D sidescrollers/platformers on here, but they only take about 2 hours or so to beat. I like these kinds of games, but I have no incentive to replay them until some time has passed. It would have been nice if they included Shining Force and Shining Force 2. I know these are both included on the PS3 Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection, but I'm thinking portable here. Still the value here is pretty good, and I can't wait to play these Phantasy Star games on a big, bright screen, anywhere I want. (I have the Phantasy Star collection for Gameboy Advance, but SP's backlight is the dim model). The only other complaint I have is that they didn't inlcude Phantasy Star 1. They have no excuse because the other 3 are on here. It just feels weird to port the last 3 Phantasy Star games and not the first. I do have Phantasy Star on my Gameboy Advance, but the screen is small and dim. It would have been really nice to play it a big,  bright PSP screen. Oh well. This being said if you're thinking about games to play on your TV, definitely get the Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection for PS3. It has about 40+ games on 1 disc. The main games that interest me for Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection are all 4 Phantasy Star games (you have to unlock Phantasy Star 1) and Shining Force 1 and 2. That's six 25-40 hour RPGs on one disc, with 34-40+ other games. That is some value! This psp collection only has about 24 games I believe.

SUre, for Netflix, it is pretty annoying but it doesn't take too long to reload and Netflix remembers the position of everything you watch. Blu-Rays do not for the most part so you will be in the middle of a movie, mean to hit the pause button and hit the stop button and suddenly you are back to the XMB. Not only do Blu-Rays not always remember where you are. Some have a bunch of non skippable previews and crap that you have to wade through to get back to where you were in the movie!! The odd thing is if you hit the circle key, you get an ""Are you sure you want to quit playback"" prompt. Guess what? You are never going to hit the tiny circle key by mistake. The big stop button? Yes you will hit it and hit it repeatedly. I recommend not having children in the room no matter what the rating is of the Blu-Ray you are seeing as you will find yourself cussing like a sailor at least three of four times per movie. ONe of the other reviewers suggested removing the stop button and I am a 100% believer in this. Grab a butter knife and pop the damn button before you pair it with your PS3!! You will thank me later.

The battery lasts FOREVER. It has buttons for all the controls on the dual shock and is pretty rugged and comfortable. My only other beef is mentioned by most people here. Touching ANY button on the remote will turn on the PS3. Make sure you place the remote somewhere where you won't hit it by mistake as you will have a PS3 that is always on.

190178,4.0,False,"02 18, 2011",A18S0KCHWYEI20,B00269DX5W,VG Fan,"Overall, this is a good game that I would definitely recommend, but perhaps not as highly as many reviewers, both professional ones and regular users.  Just so you know, I finished the game yesterday (letting you know this because it sort of bugs me when people review games they haven't finished).  I think that if you have the choice to get this game for PC (in other words, you have a fast computer than can run it with all the graphics settings turned up pretty high), you should probably do that because then you would likely find mods to increase the difficulty of combat, which is my biggest complaint with the game.

The neatest thing about the game is its faithful re-creation of Renaissance Italy.  Playing this game really makes you feel like you've gone back in time, which is really cool for anyone who is a big fan of history like I am.  In each of the cities you visit (which include Florence and Venice), the game includes many real world landmarks that are spectacularly recreated.  I haven't actually seen any of these landmarks in person, but if you go online and look at pictures, the resemblance is uncanny.  They really look just like the real things.  Even better, you get to climb all over the landmarks and check them out up close, although unfortunately you only get to go inside a few of them.  There are lots of people walking around in the cities that make them really feel alive, even though you can't interact with most of them.

The second best thing about this game is the SPECTACULAR finale.  I almost quit playing about 80 % of the way in because of the issues I detailed below, but I am very glad I didn't because the final sequence, the final fight, and the ending were really, really cool.  It definitely made me want to play the sequel.

Before I go on I want to provide just a brief summary of the game play which I found sort of difficult because it's pretty varied.  It's a bit like GTA in that you have the freedom to roam around the city basically doing as you please, although you are not permitted to just kill random innocent people.  You can earn money in various ways that you can use to improve your armor and weapons.  You can climb all over the buildings, scaling pretty much any part of them, and leap from building to building--this is one of the coolest parts of the game.

Aside from this, the core of the game and the way that you advance the story is to perform various missions, like following this person or killing that person.  Sometimes you might have to do it without guards detecting you.  You start these missions by walking into the area designating on your map and then accepting them.  Another big part of the game is what you might call collection or scavenger hunting type tasks.  One of these is that, in order to reveal the map, you have to climb to the top of various landmarks.  You also have to collect various ""codex pages,"" the locations of which are revealed when you reveal parts of the map.

Some parts of the game are optional but give you better gear or flesh out the story.  One example of this is that you can attempt to find 20 ""glyphs"" on landmarks.  When you do, you have to solve some puzzles and in return you get some extra info on the grand conspiracy that is the center of the game's plot.  This was a very cool part of the game, trying to figure out exactly what is going on with the Templars and unraveling the conspiracy.  Another example is that you can explore 6 assassin's tombs which basically entails a series of jumping puzzles (a lot more fun than I thought it would be).

Anyway, I'll now talk about the graphics.  the graphics in the game are usually very good, although some people (me included) notice various degrees of screen tearing.  For me it was definitely noticeable, but not enough to really detract from the game.  The graphics in the cut scenes are not as good as the graphics when you are roaming the world--some of the character models look a little bit odd, especially the mouths, but overall it's fine.  The sound was also good, and the music is really cool.

I enjoyed the story in this game and the feeling that you are unraveling this global conspiracy and mystery throughout the game is a very cool feeling.  This is the sort of game where you want to keep playing to see what is going to be revealed next and to advance the story, which is a very good thing.

The control scheme is another strong point of the game.  You quickly learn to climb all over buildings and climb all over the city with ease because it's a very intuitive control scheme.  The controls are also quite good for combat, although it can be tricky to target particular enemies.

Now I want to talk about the game's weak points.  The biggest flaw in this game is that combat, which plays a big role in the game, is way too easy.  It's basically impossible to die in combat--I never did.  As long as you hold R1, enemies can barely hurt you, and even when they do, you can buy a belt full of medicine that you can use to heal yourself in the middle of combat.  Because of this you can easily stand toe to toe with an army of enemies.  This means that fighting in the game becomes more of a button mashing chore than a fun part of game play.  Actually, at this point I want to say that for increased fun, if you get this game you might consider trying to not use the medicine belt at all or not upgrading to the biggest one.

The developers include various sorts of enemies that are supposed to require different tactics to defeat, but I basically never paid much attention to this because I didn't need to.  If you just mash square enough or use your counter moves you will eventually kill anything (including the final boss) without much trouble.

The fact that combat is so easy infects other parts of the game as well.  The game includes all sorts of hiding places that are supposed to be used as a way to get away from guards who you have angered.  I think this was intended to be a big part of the game, but I basically never used any of them because there is rarely any point in running away.  The only time I ran instead of fighting is when I was going to have to kill so many guards that it would just be less time consuming to run.

My second big criticism of this game is that it is a little long and gets a bit repetitive.  Of course, the length of a game can be seen as a strong suit as well since you are getting more bang for your buck.  I was about ready for the game to be over when I was 75 % of the way through, but I kept playing because I enjoyed the story and wanted to see what was going to happen.  Climbing to the top of buildings is fun for a while, but it does get old eventually.  The fighting gets boring for the reasons I described above, as does endlessly running around from place to place--the final city, Venice, is particularly large and annoying to get around in.  My advice would be to take a few weeks away from the game when you are about 50 % to 60 % of the way finished so that you can come back and have it seem fresh again.

The good:

The introduction of the quad bike. While there is only one Quad you can choose from it's a nice bike to play with. I've used it on several tracks and it was fun to use.

The tricks. The tricks are neat, easy to do but a little challenging to master. adds a nice little something extra to do while hitting those big jumps on certain tracks.

Challenging for all player levels. This game on teh easy end is easy enough anyone could pick it up and have fun and at the other end of the spectrum the extreme tracks provide a great challenge for the experts.

The track editor is similar to the evolution version. and being able to share and download user created tracks is a great thing.

The down side:

Multi-player. Currently as of this writing 04/19/2014 the only multi-player is local only. You can not play with random people or your friends over PSN (and to my understanding at all on any online service). This is a step backwards from the evolution where you would have matchmaking.

Game seems to futuristic but bikes are not. so The game has this futuristic setting. the developers are trying to inject some story line to the game by having this talking AI speak to you as you play through the tracks. This presents a bit of a visual dilemma. I am riding through a high tech futuristic morphing building while on a bike that looks like 2005 Kawasaki, or any dirt-bike for that matter.

The soundtrack. For the most part again it's kinda futuristic. Which I guess fits the theme but I really think they missed the mark with this futuristic thing. The should have stayed with the grungy dirty feel of motocross.

There are only a few skill games. and they are mixed in with the tracks. they are not a separate section like previous versions and there are not a lot of them. but on the plus side they have a hill climb like that did in the first one which was my favorite.

To be honest the first hour of this game was actually really really boring and the battles were pretty tedious so I ended up using ""auto"" for all the battles (there is a button that just lets the AI of the game battle for you but you have to press this during each turn of the battle) because that was easy and it worked.

I almost didn't pick it up after playing on it the first time.  I don't mind giving up on games at all but when I picked up the DS the next day it was still in there so I was like alright I'll give it another try.  It's actually surprised me, the story picked up a little and  I ran into a battle were ""autoing"" it wasn't working at all, which forced me to actually play the battle and learn all the cool things my characters can do and the neat mini games for the magic attacks.

I actually really appreciate having to think about the battle and also using ""auto"" to supplement my battles.  The more you play the more you will run into hard battles were you will either play completely manually or half manually and half auto and then you of course can all auto for super easy battles.  Combined with story being picked up after the first few hours this game is hard to put down now.  I can't wait to get home after work and play this game.

(1) there are minor bugs in the map system such as it went up-side-down (!) a few times (no i was not drunk, it WAS upside down) the cursor goes astray. Not a show stopper though.
(2) the essential game killer here is this: you can rest after EVERY combat, with no food / drink problems (in contrast to the 2nd edition version) so your party will always be maximally prepared (you can always save so you do this after each battle) with all the spells prepared, and you will NOT EVER be disturbed in your sleep - the bad guys simply wait for you to be slaugthered, giving indeed the game the very short life span of 8 hours.
(3) apart from level 1, the maps are very different (you can look it up via a simple internet search, it won't spoil the game) compare the original eotb maps with those of the gba also published; gba maps are too simple.
(4) the story line is weaker than that of the original: the teleportation puzzle of the dwarven/stone etc keys as i remember them is gone, and the rest is simple battle, which gets a little pointless, because all the rooms look all the same. Not a show stopper either.
(5) in battle you are given a random setup of your figures, and the figures can NOT move around each other. Which means every character must have bows in order to reach an enemy but those in front will lose a full round re-equipping. The setup of who goes in line # that is too complex and i always wind up having the figthers in the back. This really IS very frustrating.
(6) i know dnd 3rd as well as adnd, and what the dice do in this game in battle is just way too weird - far too often a miss with a fighter with a dwarven waraxe +1 on a simple skeleton. Far too often a fumble with a 3rd lvl mage with combat casting, trying to cast a magic missile (!);

Out of the box, it looks quite impressive, elegant and sturdy. The base included also looks pretty neat in the dark, but as others have stated before, the effect gets old too soon and all the flashy lights eventually become an annoyance. I am the father of two amazing kids (a 6 and 2 years old), spending all my time with them leaves me to play videogames very early in the morning or very late at night, because of that, having a good headset becomes of importance if I do not want to wake up the wife and kids with the HT on a high volume. These are not discrete and honestly will not serve my purpose because of their glow. Unfortunately, it cannot be shut off. The glow is pretty much like the LED on the PS4 controller, it looked great in pictures but once you have it in your hands and try to play at night it is distracting and annoying. This of course is my experience and I will not be giving these a bad rating because of that, I can see someone else having these and enjoying the flashy effects, it just does not suit my needs.

With that off the table, how do these perform? Well, I have not had any problems with the Wi-fi signal interfering, which is great. Also, these are wireless! forget about cables, charge the battery and enjoy the comfort of a wireless head set. They also include a microphone which I honestly have not had the chance to use. I have been playing 'Infamous Second Son' with these and the sound is pretty great. Also, it has an AUX input, which makes the headset usable with most mobile devices/mp3 players.

If you like Bioshock, Wolfenstine or any game like that, you will love this game.
And like those games you upgrade weapons and powers to make you super powerful and making the game pretty darn easy by the end.

A few problems though, it is way to short, but it didn't feel to repetitive because of it.
The levels felt very boxed in and very linear with so many invisible walls, although it appears when looking around these beautiful levels, as if you could walk, run and jump all over the place, you can not. It's got an old school feel and that's ok with me.
The guns feel crappy, lite and flimsy, I want weight to my guns, and unique sounds, these have your generic reload and shoot sounds.
Now don't get me wrong, the guns are cool, like the seeker, if you have played it, you know what I mean. Or that grenade gun thing with the balls, it's awesome .
Your TMD (time manipulation device) in the game feels like plasmids, but that's ok, because it works very well.
And speaking of the TMD you can't use it on everything, (which is weird) only things that light up your TMD crosshair.
There are ""lite"" puzzles, they're really not hard to figure out, as a game becomes more difficult so should the puzzles in that game, this is not like that in this game at all.

It's like they took all the best Sci-Fi survival horror games and took a bunch of the best parts and gimmicks, rolled them all together and made a burritos out of it. It's a delicious game. All the negatives can be over looked, by how much fun you will have playing it.

By now, everything that needs to be said about Xbox One probably has been said. However, I purchased this later in the game just so I could get Forza 5 and Horizon 2 at a lower price, and for any bugs to be worked out on the console. I did extensive research on Xbox One and Playstation 4 considering they are almost identical in terms of hardware. The PS4 has a much smaller chassis with a smaller cooling fan, while the Xbox One chassis is HUGE and it has a very large cooling fan. The Xbox One definitely resembles an old 1980s VCR. I barely had room to fit in my media cabinet.

I hooked up my Xbox One just like a traditional game console: HDMI to the HDMI switch. I don't care for Kinect or using the Xbox One as a multimedia receiver. That said, there is a feature with Xbox One to put it in standby mode for ""Instant On"" capability. I quickly learned that this feature consumes about 40W of power! I switched that setting off, so that it completely shuts down to save on my energy bill.

I would have assumed that with the 8-core processor, gobs of memory, and overall updated hardware that it would boot faster than my Xbox 360 Slim. Instead, the Xbox One feels just as slow as Xbox 360. Forza 5 and Horizon 2 have cool effects like tire smoke, particles from grass/objects, but that is about it. I really don't feel that much of a difference from Forza 4 and Horizon, certainly not enough to justify buying a new console. The 1080P resolution just means the text is much smaller than before. Game load times are about the same, if not slower at times.

The controller layout is the same as before, but the overall feel is different as if it was made for slightly smaller hands. The batteries sit deeper into the unit so there's no compartment sticking out. In addition, there seems to be dedicated force feedback for the trigger buttons. In Forza 5, if I lock up my brakes, the brake trigger will vibrate. If I lose traction during takeoff, I will feel vibration through the throttle trigger.

Overall: 4/5 decent next-gen console, but it just doesn't feel next-gen enough. Load times are just as bad. And games have to be installed at about 35GB a pop. The 500GB hard drive only has about 360GB free once the console is set up without ANY apps or games. So that means a max of about 10 games can be installed at a time. I also kind of wish it had a solid state drive instead of a much slower hard drive.","""Meh..."" Not that much of an upgrade over Xbox 360",1425081600,,,

If I had a choice of whether to play Gamecube or DS, it would be the DS.  One of the reasons is because of Yoshi Touch and Go.  I can't stop playing it.

(8 score) Plotline: Continuing the story from Yoshi's Island but from a different view point. A stork is carrying 2 babies when Kamek attacks and the stork drops both babies. You must guide Baby Mario to the ground collecting coins(The more coins you get the better the Yoshi)and dodging enemies. Bay Mario can only take 3 hits and then Game Over. After 1000 yards(3000 feet) of falling, you'll land on a Yoshi's back and try to get as far as you can wuthout getting hit or you'll die(Talking about Marathon mode).

Fred's Marathon High score: 6780 yards

(10 score)Control: Rather simple, poke Yoshi to make him jump, draw a line to make a bridge of clouds, encircle enemies in clouds to turn them into bubbles and slide them, and poke somewhere on the screen to throw an egg at the designated area.

(9 score)Sound: Classic Yoshi grunts and noises. All the noises for the enemies are still the same. Music seems rather classic and fits the levels nicely.

(7 score)Graphics: The graphics aren't as good as those of Yoshi Island because they don't look as crisp. The graphics seem to fit the game though...

(8 score) Multiplayer: This would seem like a big thing for this kind of game but it's not that great. You can still do single-card play or multi-card play with multi-player. This is sort of like marathon mode only it's not never ending. The person who gets to the end will win but if someone dies the other person wins. A lot of people would think that you would get there at the same time but no. Say there's someone who doesn't like to waste eggs and likes to dodge enemies while the other person is all about killing everything. The person who likes to dodge would be behind the person who likes to kill for a little while because he's creating more paths to cross because he's making a lot of bridges. But he'll eventually catch up because the person who likes to kill will probably run out of eggs.

(9 score) Entertainment: Yoshi Touch and Go is one of those games that's good for playing about 30 minutes at a time and those 30 minutes will only seem about 5 minutes. So this game is a great time killer if you have nothing better to do. This game is rather amusing to play.

(10 score) Glitches: I've come across no glitches in this game.

(8 score)Replay value: Even though this game has no story mode, it still has 4 great game modes you can play. I would consider Marathon mode to be the main mode because it's never ending and has an assortment of levels that are randomized so you'll never know what level will pop up next. Most people consider that the days of getting the best high score are over. But they're not, it's the thing that keeps thriving you to play. A never ending game mode will provide a good long game time.

Overall score: Check my personal ratings below.

0-5 Bad, 5-6 So-so, 6-7 Okay, 7-8 good, 8-9 great, 9-10 excellent.

It has to be above 6 for me to approve the game to recommend it to you.

I saw this game at the store for less then $10 and gave it a shot and at the time I was looking for a different experience in a different genre of games.

I was a never a die hard halo fan but I appreciated the series good sci-fi settings and characters. And in this game its a prequel to all the other halo games, which gave me another reason to try out.

The game surprised me because I found myself interested from the get go, thanks to some high production from the cutscenes and voice work.
The gameplay is going to be divided for many who are familiar with this genre. For starters the game is very bare bones, its a very stripped down real time strategy game. And I can see why if the game got anymore complex the game would have to be shipped with a mouse and keyboard.

The controls can get confusing if your new to console RTS and it doesnt help that your limited to options when it comes to said controls. You cant configure controls in anyway.

The game looks and sounds fantastic especially in the halo universe you'll see and hear familiar locales and sound bits.

There are also characters that are precursors to the later halo game characters. Its very interesting especially to someone like me who is still new to the halo lore.

I will honestly say that this is the game that really got me into halo, I did play and beat HCE and enjoyed it but I really didn't get how big the scale was of the universe and just saw it as another great sci fi game like doom and half life, this game shows you the war in a prequel setting.

However, this newest DBZ game in the Budokai series, Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3, was something that was extremely unique and different from its predecessors and included few of the most amazing features that makes it one of the best DBZ, let alone, one of the best fighting games to this day. Or so how I extremely wished that to be true.
Very disappointingly, it's not what you have seen in the past and it's actually becoming rather repetitive than anticipated.

First of all BT3 keeps many of it's wonderful(?) or bad(?) features (you decide as I think it depends on taste) mostly the same from its predecessors. One main ""new"" thing that I could think of was the addition of new characters which in all, add up to over 150 characters. Besides from this addition, I can't say that much else is new. But as a DBZ fan, I'm satisfied with the mere fact that it has over 150 characters. However, it still is missing some of characters that I wished were included in the series such as Frieza's dad, who even showed up in the fight against Devilman, Super Saiyan 2 Future Trunks (I remember it being included in one of the previous games), Krillin's older form, and much more. Maybe I'm asking too much but I'm sure some other hardcore DBZ fans like me feels the same way.
Gameplay, graphics, and sound are all similar and are neither great nor terrible.
Replay value is also only average as there are tons of things to do but many features get dull or repetitive.

Lastly, I have to say that this game is definitely the best game in the budokai series as it keeps the same features from the past but has more characters than any other DBZ games (even more than Burst Limit, the new DBZ game which was released for PS3 and Xbox 360) and I strongly recommend to the fans of the franchise, but to the casual gamers who are looking for a great fighting game, think about it twice before buying it or rather, borrow or rent it beforehand to decide whether this game is for you or not.",A true sequel or just a combination of previous games?,1216425600,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

You play Mario, and Donkey Kong has stolen wind up Mario doll toys from a toy factory. Yes, this is seriously the plot! As Mario, you start a level, and you are able to jump (A button), when on top of objects, you can lift them over your head (B button), and you can perform advanced tricks, like pressing left, right and the A button to perform a high jump. The eight levels each have two parts to them, the first part, Mario must get the key to a door, then get it back to the door, if he throws the key (which sometimes you need to), Mario will have 12 seconds to get the key again and pick it up, or else it will disappear and return to where the key was originally. Then the second part is just to get to the wind up Mario doll and pick it up. It is a puzzle game, because in each level, there are red, yellow and blue switches, where if you hit a red switch, it makes red platforms and ladders appear, and the colored platforms and ladders disappear. After the first world it gets more tricky with vines and cables for Mario to climb, then in later levels there are conveyer belts with switches to reverse them. Timing is also important, such as in some levels you must throw a key onto a conveyer belt, and hit a switch to reverse the conveyer belt, then race to hit a switch to enable a yellow colored platform before the key drops off the belt into something that could destroy the key. There are also enemies that are strategically placed, along with ways to get around them or make them disappear. The levels are not big, only four screens large, but the levels don't need to be large, from how clever Nintendo has made the puzzles. Each world has a theme to it, the first level is the toy factory theme, second is a forest theme, third is a lava palace and three other themes. The first six levels of each world are strictly to get a key and get a Mario doll in each of them. Then the seventh level of each world is where Mario must lead the six wind-up Mario dolls through the level, if one of the dolls don't make it to the end of the level, that will effect the eighth level. The eight level of each world is a battle with Donkey Kong. For each level you have to do something different to beat the bad monkey, while Donkey Kong stands in one place and does something to defend himself, usually by throwing things at Mario. However many of the six dolls that made it through the seventh level will be how much energy Mario has when he faces Donkey Kong, so if three wind-up Mario dolls get destroyed in the seventh level, Mario can be hit three times in his battle with Donkey Kong at the end of each world. At the start of each level, it shows you how to perform a new trick or a hint to get you past something. This is a generalized hint, nothing specific, with a little animation showing you how to do the trick. While this is a good puzzle game, most of it is easy, but unfortunately there is not much replay value in the game.

I almost bought a 2DS, but ultimately decided to go with this for the bigger screen and I'm very happy I did. The build quality is great, and after using it for several months it still feels as solid as it did on day one. The controls are really nice, but as many other people have said, your hands can start to hurt after a long gaming session. This isn't really a problem for me, as I generally only play for 20 minutes or so at a time. My only complaint is that, with the bigger screen, the image does not look as crisp as most people are probably used to when they play on a smartphone or other handheld console like the Vita. This isn't a huge problem, but the resolution definitely doesn't come close to current standards (but the 3DS is a few years old, so I let this slide).

I find the game selection to be great. During my commute I generally like to play more chill games like Mario, Zelda, and Animal Crossing, and the 3DS has a lot of these. The battery life is great, and I can usually go for a couple days playing (with the brightness all the way up) before having to charge it. I usually leave the 3D effect turned off, and only use it for certain games. For a lot of games, I find it to be distracting, especially since the viewing angle is extremely limited, plus the battery lasts a lot longer with it turned off. It is still really nice to use sometimes, and I'm glad it's an option.

Heck, I wasn't even that much into Zelda at that time, but I remember when the whole Wii reveal was commencing, and the new Zelda game just blew people away. My roommate's eyes widened when he saw the first trailer in 2005 (he was a huge Zelda nut), and I knew I had to get into Zelda before TP (as it would come to be known). So, along with coming to know the Wii's hardware, I was excited about the game. Very much that I had to pre-order it before I even had the system; thankfully, I used a friend's.

Come the release of the game, and I was shocked. Not by the greatness of the game, but how the Wii's controls didn't work as I expected. I thought it was the control itself--maybe it was faulty--but I learned that Link didn't have 1:1 movement. Heck, the Wii didn't have 1:1 precision. Still, that didn't deter me from playing and enjoying the game.
I had played only Ocarina and the original Zeldas beforehand, so when I started the game and got a good ways into it, I I realized it was very formulaic, but still kept the edge by having Link transform into a wolf, not to mention it was the ""darkest"" Zelda out there, giving Hyrule a shadowed theme and having the characters look more real than ever (as real as they can look).

The usual minigames were present, and the arsenal didn't feel entirely revolutionary. What was great, though, was fighting on Epona and utilizing wolf Link's abilities. The fights with wolf Link left me wanting to transform back to human, but it weren't entirely irritating. Midna is a great addition to the franchise, though she did, like Link's many female companions, become slightly annoying at times. The final fight was great, implementing a wide range of the installment's weaponry and the Wii's controls (considering it was an enhanced GameCube game), ended up being my favorite Zelda game--until Skyward Sword.

It was easy to anticipate what would be great about the game and know what likely wouldn't be up to par.

For those most part those expectations have been precisely met. MLB 15: The Show is a fantastic game that has improved on it's strengths but done little with its weaknesses.

The digital launch of the game has gone much smoother than last year when the game was delayed reaching the store for download. The process was much smoother thanks to the ability to pre-load, the game unlocked at midnight eastern, and was ready to play immediately in its entirety. Those who bought physical copies were met by a limited demo while the game was installing. In similar fashion to NBA 2K15 they found themselves stuck in that for hours without an indication of why that was (because it had yet to complete its installation).

The first thing I did in game was to migrate my saves from MLB 14 to MLB 15. The process was super simple and went without a hitch. For those coming from PS4 last year the game scours the hard drive for the saves. Anyone that desires carrying over progress from the PS3 or Vita have to make sure to use the Cloud Saves feature.

Gameplay and graphics will be familiar to anyone who played the game last year, or even going back further, but that doesn't mean they haven't progressed. Framerate problems have been cleared up and player movement feels more responsive and realistic. The new Directional Hitting makes for a good option to consider at the plate. I've enjoyed using it so far even though production has yet to follow. Those struggling to hit may want to try changing the hitting camera. Each one offers advantages and disadvantages in reading pitches and judging timing. Graphically the game looks great and improvements to lighting are well worth noting.

The Show is known for its attention to detail and authenticity, but there are a few things that immediately appear somewhat opposed to that. One is with the equipment that can be assigned to players in Road to the Show and Diamond Dynasty that boosts their ratings. It's somewhat understandable to assign boosts to licensed equipment but things like chewing gum, candles, having a sleeping companion, and four leaf clovers are a little more questionable. Ultimately if it's looked at as just a fun thing that's fine, but people who value realism may not like the implications of equipment and rituals having ""powers"".

Road to the Show is essentially a copy of last year with the only exception being the ability to assign that equipment to players. Franchise mode is similar also but now incorporates sponsorships which go towards building a bigger budget for the team, includes an option to have contracts for General Managers, adds in a mediocre radio show while in the menus, and legends can be turned on to be available in the free agent pool.

Baseball fans, and certainly those that play The Show religiously, will always be able to identify things from watching real games that didn't make the translation to the video game. As a fan of the Mariners several of them stood out immediately. Fernando Rodney doesn't do the arrow celebration after a save, his hat isn't crooked, the new Sunday uniforms are missing, Safeco Field's roof doesn't close, and there's no King's Court for Felix Hernandez starts. Surely there are things similar to those missing from every team and that's the next level of authenticity for The Show to work on achieving.

One disappointment so far is with the lack of emotion and personality that was promoted for the product. Very few instances of this have been witnessed. The crowd seems to be enhanced, especially in the postseason with the towels back after not making it in last year, but for the most part the players all seem to act the same. Maybe some instances will be found as the game is played more but I would have expected to witness some of it by now.

While SCEA has worked on making the great qualities of The Show even better they've let the troubled aspects linger. Commentary needs to be rebooted - there's really no question about that - and Online Play is still unreliable. Online seems to have improved in terms of performance as lag isn't affecting timing and the result has been better hitting averages and fewer strikeouts. Despite that crashes to the dashboard and opponents seeing different things happen on screen remain serious problems that need attention.

Loading times have been improved significantly and that benefits everyone who spends any time in the game. Diamond Dynasty though seems plagued by slow server response making navigation and tasks tedious to complete. Conceptually the changes to Diamond Dynasty represent a move in the right direction, however it still feels somewhat overwhelming for beginners. Getting bonus stuff through Universal Rewards is great, even every 9 day stretch of signing into the game will get you a free pack, but then there's the marketplace where it would cost you $616 to buy a Brooks Robinson card which is somewhat amusing!

There's still a lot more to dig into with MLB 15: The Show and I'll be updating this review as I go!

They provide good traction for your thumbs that's a great alternative to the Dualshock4's rubber coating. And unlike the DS4 rubber coating, it won't rub down to nothing in the long run. I was originally afraid the white portion on the thumb grips are made of soft sticky silicone, but thankfully they're not. The entire grip is made of soft plastic, which surprisingly provides a great grip for your thumbs even if they are wet from sweat. I haven't had an experience where my thumbs slipped off since using these grips.

The only downside from these grips, they don't provide a smooth rotation on the thumb sticks. Because these grips cover the entire thumb sticks, the bottom plastic touches the controller, and thus doesn't provide a smooth rotation. It doesn't prevent games from being played, but it's something you'll have to get adjusted to. If not for this, these grips would be a perfect accessory to the DS4, especially if your DS4's rubber coating is beginning to wear out.",Really great grip,1459555200,,,

The plot is average, voice acting is corny and the profanity is excessive but who cares? What makes this fun is teaming up against your enemy.
I wish you could switch between Rios and Salem during the game & that the masks weren't specific to each character.
The back to back feature is a lot of fun. In general the cooperative nature of the game makes it unique. Your partner's AI is pretty good with the exception of one situation: on the Miami mission shortly after entering SSC HQ my partner is wounded and I am required to revive him. However he always falls under the globe-like structure in the middle of the lobby...I can't heal him without being shot and it's impossible to drag him to cover. I had to have a friend come over to play the other character so I could beat the game. Which made me realize that multiplayer is the ideal way to approach this game.
Another knock against the game is it's length-way too short.

It had it all - Memorable characters, action, humor, and just plain silliness. As a result, it was an overall great show that was loved by many. With that said, it was of course subject to merchandising and....of course...video games. With a trio of unappealing Game Boy Color games, and a horrendous-looking Power Stone-esc fighter on the N64/PS1, it seemed like it can't go anywhere but down in terms of licensees. This Game Boy Advance game corrects that issue, fortunately.

Mojo Jojo a-Go-Go is a Powerpuff game that keeps it safe and simple. It is a 2D auto-scrolling shooter in the vein of games such as Gradius. As Blossom, Bubbles, or Buttercup, you have to shoot down hordes of bad guys and retrieve jewels they drop when they are destroyed. You can also punch, but it's only for if the enemy's too close of a range for you to kill by shooting. On top of being able to pick up and throw a background object at the enemies every now and then, you can also power-up your laser (and sometimes punch) by collecting various symbol-y things you may find in the air. Upgrades include one-hit kills, triple shots, and the like.

Being the shooter it is, it makes for a nice fun little gem to play. Like other games of its kind, Mojo Jojo a-Go-Go isn't very long, as it lasts 6 stages, but lemme tell ya. If there's one thing that keeps this game from being a full recommendation, it's the DIFFICULTY. The game can get brutal with the kinds of enemies they throw at you, especially if you're going after the jewels. There will indeed be at least a few times where an area becomes ""bullet-hell"", as bullets are fired pretty much everywhere onscreen.

What also doesn't help is that the levels themselves overstay their welcome. I can imagine a player easily being worn out from the game after at least one level of play, because it's so dang long! Worse of all - There are NO checkpoints. If you lose all 3 girls, it's Game Over, and when going back to the level, you have to start at the beginning of the level. It doesn't get any more frustrating than that.

Meanwhile, the bosses are easy and...sometimes underwhelming. EX: You know that octopus-esc mech that's on the cover art of the game? Yeah, well that boss took me less than a minute to beat. Not joking there.

However, the gameplay does rely on strategic elements. Since each girl has her own health bar and holds any laser upgrades they've picked up, the game provides a nice element of strategy. Is the girl you're playing as on low health? Switch her out! Want to pick up a certain upgrade, but don't want to use the one you have? Switch out!

All in all, while the game has 6 pretty loooooong levels, and has a difficulty that only hardcore players may as well enjoy, I've had a good time with the game while it lasted. After all, the graphics are great and well-polished in 2D, the music is catchy (although kinda repetitive), and the gameplay is simple and fun. The jewels even help add replayability to the game, since there's an unlockable 7th level if you collect enough.

You have guide Mickey and Minnie through five levels to save their mystery friend. Who is their mystery friend and why is he or she in danger? Well, it wouldn't be a mystery if I told you! :P Minnie follows behind Mickey and mimics his every action.

The graphics are pretty nice for a NES game. They're a little basic in terms of design, but they come together to make a nice cartoon-esque style, which is quite fitting for a Mickey Mouse game. The music is also pretty fair.

The gameplay is just normal 2D platformer stuff, with a small twist. You have to account for what Minnie is doing. There are jumps where Minnie will cause you to lose a life if you don't account for where she will land. There are parts where Mickey almost has to take damage to make sure Minnie doesn't fall into a hole or drown in the ocean (how sweet. :P). It's an interesting gameplay feature, and one that wasn't explored to its full potential by this game.

The controls are pretty good, albeit a little inconsistent. In three levels, you cannot fall backwards in the air while jumping. However, in the other two levels, you have complete control over where Mickey and Minnie land. But fortunately, the levels that you can do this in are the levels in which you need to do it the most.

One thing I don't like about this game is that birds will sometimes appear to kidnap Minnie. It happens when you think you've found a hidden item. You shoot the item until opens, and it turns out to be a bird that could increase the current level's length by as much as an hour. Since Minnie has been kidnapped, you cannot leave the level until you find her. So, you have to find the area where a teleporation key will spawn that take you to where MInnie is being held. This wouldn't be so bad if you just automatically got Minnie after entering the that room, but they decided to place four fake Minnie Mouses in there with her. What's worse is that the position of the real Minnie appears to change each time you enter the room.

Another thing that's kind of lame is the lack of a real co-op mode. I can't say this for sure, but it definitely seems like everything is already here for a co-op mode except the option to let one player control Minnie. You could actually play this game with two people, but I wouldn't recommend it. The first and second players control both Mickey and Minnie at the same time, which will invariably cause you to be dragged into a direction that you didn't want to go.

But aside from those two little gripes, I think that Mickey Mousecapades is a pretty good game. It's hard in a couple of spots, but it's nonetheless pretty forgiving. There are actually Level-Select codes in the manual which will allow players to come back to the levels they're struggling with. But you don't get to see the ending cutscene unless you beat all five levels in succession, so there's reason to play more even after beating all of the levels with Level Select codes.

The game length is quite brief, taking perhaps forty-five minutes if you're pretty good at it. But even so, it's a worthwhile title to pick up if you're into 2D platformers.",A Decent Kid's Game,1362355200,,,

This is one of those rare moments for me where I started a game and played nothing else until it was finished...and even then I want to play it over again right away!  No, it's not a perfect game, but above all else Dante's Inferno is just plain FUN!

It's a hack 'n' slash game, and to say it's similar to Sony's God of War is the understatement of the century.  Let's get this out of the way, it is a God of War clone down to the tiniest detail.  If you've played (and enjoyed) the God of War games, you will be right at home here as there is almost NO learning curve whatsoever.  Therefore, if you're looking for original gameplay, then stay far away from this one.  But hey, God of War I & II were two of the finest video games ever created, so if you really enjoyed those two, you should get Dante's Inferno straight away!  The level design is just as innovative since it was designed by the person who actually DID the God of War games.  Several time throughout the game I knew what I had to do because I recognized the situation in GoW, so yeah, many parts of this game are pretty familiar.  However, this is also what makes it such a good game.  I simply could not put the controller down.  In addition, there are a good bit of collectibles to find and abilities to power up.

This game takes place in the nine circles of Hell, and boy, Visceral Games did not shy away from creating a hellish atmosphere.  Straight out of Dante Aligheri's Divine Comedy, the imagery of the poem's Hell truly comes to life.  Souls constantly scream in agony, demons and other grotesquely deformed semblances of humanity are thrown at you, and as you descend into the lower circles the ominous forboding feeling of Hell itself is always felt.  The circles are all distinctly different.  For example, Lust is shown as a whirling windstorm around a demonically sexualized tower, Gluttony is a realm of digestion and all the bodily functions that accompany it, Violence is a trip through a river of boiling blood, and the final circle of Treachery is an icy void that ends in front of a towering Lucifer.  The scenery is incredibly impressive, and to me, THIS is what makes this game work.

The story isn't the breakthrough that God of War's is, however.  The Divine Comedy serves as a benchmark to begin this tale, but many liberties were taken for obvious reasons.  Dante is not a poet, he's a warrior from the Crusades.  Characters such as Cleopatra and King Minos became bosses, etc, but the basic framework of Aligheri's Inferno are there.  I didn't expect to see Lucifer as described in the poem, but alas there he was.  In this game, Dante travels through Hell to rescue his Beatrice.  Flashbacks occur that showcase the events that formed Dante's past, but for the most part they are nonsensical.  The character of Virgil acts as a ghostly guide for Dante, and through this character we learn about Hell and why it is how it is.  Not until the last three or four circles does the story come together, but when it does it's really good.  The ending of the game is downright epic, and after seeing it I'm hoping this game sells well enough for the potential sequel.

Technically, the game is merely competent.  The scenery, as I mentioned, is wonderful...however the character models could definitely have used some polish. Some of the special effects also seem somewhat last-generation.  However, the game does run silky smooth at a constant 60 fps with no screen tear or aliasing.  The movie cutscenes (of which there are only four), are superb and fortunately you can view them at any time once you reach them.  Lengthwise, this game is on the short side.  Ten levels in all, roughly 7 or 8 hours on easy.  However, there will be downloadable content released in April that will add multiplayer co-op and user-created content.  Plus getting all trophies/achievements will require more than one playthrough as it's difficult to obtain all upgrades (a second playthrough will include all the upgrades you had when you finished).

Many people who saw the movie were dissapointed because it was much worse than the first one. But, the game somewhat makes up for it. First off, I realize that many reviews from magazines and such have not been giving this game great reviews. This is because there are a lot of technical difficulties with this game, including it being short, having graphical problems, controls being fustrating at times, and there are a few glitches in gameplay. However, this game is great nonetheless.
Enter the Matrix is a fun-filled action game with a lot of replay value (there are two different characters you could play as). This game is purely action. Between driving cars and ships, shooting from turrets and cars, shooting with guns on the ground, and just plain awesome fighting, this game has a variety of different gameplay. It also has a fantastic story line if you like The Matrix series because it fills in many gaps in The Matrix Reloaded.

You lead a 4-man fire team engaging in missions against the Chinese forces that have occupied an oil-rich Russian island.

While the Lego video games don't necessarily have the greatest level design, I can't deny the fact I find these games incredibly fun.  The fact that you can co-op through these games makes it all the more fun.

Indiana Jones was an excellent trilogy to bring in Lego format.  Though since they've progressed with this stuff... I kind of want to see a Lego Aliens/Predator series; I think that would be amazing!  Anyway, experiencing Indy in Lego format was great fun.  Basically if you've gone through the Lego Star Wars stuff then you already know the name of the game.  Playing the game in Story Mode can actually be pretty difficult, even for two people.  Once you're done that you get the chance to go through the game in Free Play, and for me, this is where the game really shines.  You get to use an array of different characters and you get to explore the maps for lost treasures and other hidden items.  I don't know what it is about doing this, but I find it incredibly fun.  I think the Lego games are a nice break from the usual fairly serious games I play like Half Life 2 or Mass Effect for example.

Some of the levels are a bit frustrating, but I've come to expect that when dealing with Lego developed games.  They also hide some of these items very well, so they are quite a challenge to find.  The hours of game play you get out of this makes it rather worthwhile in my opinion.

I really don't have much to say on this game other than if you've already got experience with Lego Star Wars, you know what to expect.  If this is your first Lego game, don't get too frustrated, they don't make the puzzles completely obvious.  In the end I had a lot of fun; however, I still wouldn't rank these types of games as the top games ever made.

Most people who have lived around the time that this classic came out remember back in the early 90s when gamers everywhere held tightly onto their NES's and shouted ""Mario! Mario!"" all over the world... Okay, maybe not, but that's how the one SMB3 commercial went anyway. So it seemed that with the (then)recent release of SMB3, the plumber would always dominate 2D platforming... or would he? The Sega Genesis had been out for a couple of years by this point, and while there were many classics, no mascot was there to stand up to all the koopa troopas and toadstools of the big N. Enter Yugi Naka and crew to come up with the true origin of the battle between the 16-bit giants Nintendo and Sega: the creation of Sonic The Hedgehog.

So what does this new blue hero in red shoes have to offer that a fat mushroom-eating plumber doesn't? Well for one, Sonic is FAST. Not nearly as much as in any of the sequels, but for 1991, this kind of speedy sidescrolling gameplay was unheard of, and drew many crowds. I remember being taken by storm when my cousin first bought a Sega with the original Sonic game. It brings back so many memories of middle childhood. The gameplay is rather basic, with only a run, jump, and spin attack to combat the levels, but really that's all you need here. For new gamers that have just started playing the recent Sonic games, THIS is the game that introduced rings, TV Powerups, loops, animal-freeing, chaos emeralds, instant-death spikes, Dr. Robotnik, underwater drowning, bumpers, catapults, springs, and the Green Hill Zone. Plus, the game is divided into different zones, and within each zone are several acts, which are merely just stages. With all that it has going for it, how does it measure up to its sequels? Let's look at the pros and cons:

PROS:

-While the SNES probably had better graphics, color palettes, and scaling effects, I still have yet to see a SNES game with as smooth of the gameplay framerate as any Genesis Sonic title (I'm talking about normal in-game play that's NOT a special FX chip or anything like that).

-NICE BALANCE OF DIFFICULTY. The first few zones aren't too difficult to get the hang of, though once you reach the Labyrinth Zone, it does jump quite a bit.

-LARGE NON-LINEAR STAGES. Although the sequels get a lot better at this (especially Sonic 3), these zones all have original and varying environmental themes and seem just the right length for the pace that the platforming has set. It lets you speed through most of them in little time, and also lets you explore their depths as well.

-And speaking of stages, this one of the FEW Sonic games with three acts per zone as opposed to two.

-CHAOS EMERALD COLLECTING GIVES THE GAME SOME REPLAY VALUE. In the Mario games, you could collect all the secret powerups in the game, but the ending would never change. Not so with Sonic. If you manage to collect 50 rings and reach the end of a stage, you can jump through a giant ring and tackle a special stage to collect one of six chaos emeralds, which if acquired, enables a better ending.

-GREAT VARIETY OF ENEMIES. A lot of the robots you fight here are classic staples of the series, such as the crab, hornet, and caterpillar. The bosses are rather interesting as well.

-I can't end the pros without mentioning that this game has AN EXCELLENT SOUNDTRACK. The Greenhill Zone, Scrap Brain Zone, and title themes especially WILL get stuck in your head (Thankfully all are memorably good!).

CONS

-The TIMER for each stage can be an annoyance for those who like to explore the levels. It's usually only useful for getting points in beating the levels fast, but you will ALWAYS die whenever the clock hits 10 minutes.

-Since the speed dash ability isn't here yet, the game will seem a bit slower-paced than all the others. Just to warn any newcomers.

-The SPECIAL STAGES ARE TOUGH FOR MOST PEOPLE. I'm not complaining so much because I enjoy a good challenge, but for the sake of beginners it's waaaaay too simple to lose in the special stages. Interestingly enough, it becomes a mini-game in Sonic & Knuckles, a few years down the road.

-THE INSTANT DEATH SPIKES!! I guess the programmers of the original Mega Man game got together with the Sonic team here because what both games have in common is the way their spikes kill the player even while they're flashing.

-NO CHARACTERS AND VERY LITTLE STORY. Tails wouldn't show up til the sequel, Knuckles and Amy Rose were down the road a bit, and everyone else was just a thought. So that leaves just Sonic and Dr. Robotnik. The plot basically boils down to:""The animals have been captured by Dr. Robotnik. Sonic is here to rescue them."" That's it. Supposedly, I heard that the Death Egg ship was being built during this game's timeline, but it was never officially mentioned, so I'll consider it separate from the Sonic 2, Sonic 3, and S&K continuous stories.

Other than that, Sonic 1 is a classic Sega staple. Pure and simple. It's a 5 star game in comparison to other platformers, but I'm just giving it 4 stars when standing up to the other games in the series. So if you have an old Genesis, or if you bought the Sonic Mega Collection, and if you happen to be a fan of the games, DON'T SKIP OUT ON THIS ONE! It made the series what it is today, and serves as important history for video games. PLAY IT NOW!",4.5 stars - A classic which will be greatly built upon,1126742400,3,,

I pre-ordered UAW:EA and I usually don't pay games at the 60 dollar price point but I'm glad I did. These guys are the original C&C fans and they know how to make good in depth RTS games and I love to support such a great team. Unfortunately they sided with Sega which is not a publisher that I would care for. However overall this game is a ton of fun to play and the gameplay is great. The game is well balanced as with no patches at the moment and that is rare for many RTS games. I'd rate this game a 4 out of 5 being great but not perfect.

So a little of the story, Universe at War is a homage to Starcraft with three radically different races, you always feel like you are playing a different custom and culture when you play the Novus, Hierarchy, or Masari. The Hierarchy are an alien race moving from one planet to the next gobbling up the universe of life and now they have invaded Earth. Luckily the Novus are right on their trail and you find out that they have been fighting the Hierarchy for some time now. Later on you find where the Masari come into all of this but I don't want to spoil it for you and it is better to experience the story playing the game.

At first I played the game and had a bit of slow framerate issues and it happened to lock up on me twice. Then after checking out online references I found that there was a fix to this. In order to get smooth uninterrupted gameplay you have to clear your cache on your hard drive and turn up tactical speed, (speed when fighting in matches) which is located in the options menu of the game. After doing these two techniques, wow, the game runs smoothly and has never locked up on me since and I can't complain. A patch is in the works to fix a few things like allowing hackers to auto defend areas they are set to, fix the framerate issues from the start and mainly to add in the cross-platform playability.

One really nice feature here is how they made a PC RTS play and work on a console. The 360 controls are very intuitive but may be a bit of a learning curve to understand. The basics are the same, press A to select unit(s) and press A again to move them to that position. You can hold down the Right Trigger and this will blow up your map so you can see details and also allow you to order units using the minimap. I don't know how many PC games don't let you do this and it's a must in any RTS. Also all of your units are grouped in the beginning, all one type infantry, all one type anti-inf vehicles, anti-building vehicles, this type air units and your hero. It is all grouped for you so you don't have to make groups of similar units as you do in my PC RTS games or click and drag to select your army. The bumpers are used to select your research and your army. The LB allows you to scroll through the UAW themed circular interface to see what patch or upgrade you want to implement, what research you want to do, what super weapon ability you want to use. Accordingly the RB allows you to scroll through a similar interface and pick grouped units, the ones that have been grouped for you, and to also deselect those units. One advanced feature I found out was if you select all your units on the map and then hold down the RB and place the screen over the units you don't want, say units defending your base, and hit X you will deselect these units but not all of that unit type. Most of the people I've talked to about this game didn't know that and I find it is crucial to a good microing of your army. The controls are taught to you as you play the campaign so don't just jump into skirmish mode and think you can play.^^

Visually the game looks great, the graphics are top notch and you would have to have a high system PC to run it at the settings it is set for the Xbox 360. There are plenty of explosions and lush environments to make playing this on your TV or LCD monitor, (I play on the big TV in the living room and also on an extra LCD monitor in the den) a blast to look at. In audio terms, fans of Frank Klepacki can take a sigh of relief as the composer creates a slew of great sounding tracks for each race and the game uses an adaptive music system so it will change on the fly when you attack the enemy or it attacks you. I was really disappointed with C&C3 due to the repetitive dull environmental music they composed for it but you have the great electronic rock and roll sound you have come to love from Frank Klepacki in Universe at War. Also the game's voice overs are done well and the many other audio sounds of the game add great depth and feel to each race.

At the moment we're all waiting for Sega to ok the patch to allow cross-platform play as well as many other needed tweaks but overall the game is very fun to play and the amount of gameplay really adds to this fun. Playing as the Novus with their flow conduits and guerrilla warfare, the Hierarchy and their enormous Walkers that act as their movable assault bases, or the Masari with their enormous potential to harness nature and switch between light and dark mode all feel very different and not just different unit skins for each race. There is a 90 unit population cap, similar to Warcraft 3, and this is set in place to make games playable on the console, (the PC version also has the same pop cap) but to employ a good amount of strategy for the player to decide how and which units to use against their opponent be it AI or human. I can't really talk about the multiplayer as this option is not available to me due to the lack of broadband options for me, (only one I have is satellite which doesn't work well with games) but this game was created to be played against humans and with the real time strategy in mind. The single player allows you to play through the campaign of each race and to attempt to ""Conquer the World"", where you are taking place in a real time game of ""RISK"" fighting over one territory after the next. You also are given the typical skirmish matches with a ton of maps to choose which I haven't even delved into but will probably as I finish the scenarios conquering the world. Did I mention achievements yet?! lol

So overall this isn't the console RTS that will make people say yea this can be done on the console. It had a pretty rough start and the fact that when you make your units move to the location on the map the fastest by doubling clicking A, (instead of just hitting A), and your units move to that spot but don't stop and pursue any enemies on the way can cause some unrest in a few gamers. Personally I'm good a micromanaging since I've played RTS games on my PC from Dune 1 and it should be said that vehicles and air units will attack on the way but infantry will not. Really the game is a ton of fun to play, the controls are great and allow you to micro on a console, playing RTS games on your big TV are great, and the soundtrack for the game keeps you pumped and motivated to defend or take over Earth! Hope you enjoyed my review or it gave you a bunch of important info on the game. Don't take my word for it, give it a rent, you'll be glad you did.

The baseball bat, tennis racket, and golf club share the same handle.  The Wii controller fits into the handle.  The handle screws onto each attachment.  The protective clear cover on the controller must be removed first.

The baseball bat makes hitting much more fun.  It's made of a lightweight plastic so it isn't even close to the weight of a real bat.  (Which is a good thing for your TV).  I still found myself assuming a batter's stance and following through on my swing.  Oh, the controller must be removed during pitching.  Not a big deal since it just slides out of the handle.

The tennis racket is sorely needed.  It makes the tennis game much more fun.  Stepping into forehand and backhand shots feels realistic.  The racket was so much fun that I now play 5-6 games each time I fire up the Wii.

The golf club is nice but very short.  I wish it had a little more length to it.  Controller is about 2ft fully extended.  Perhaps attaching a weight to the club head might help.

The only game on this collection that I played extensively in the arcades is Smash TV, which is the newest game featured.  Most of these games, like Defender, Joust and Klax, I know only from the Atari or Nintendo home versions, and a few I've never played.
That said, this is still an amazing collection, even if you don't remember any of them.  I think the cream of the crop is probably Klax, a Tetris-based puzzle game with interesting sound effects and changing goals.  Marble Madness is also great.  Even though it's extremely short (you could finish the whole game in about five minutes), it will take you a long time to become good enough to do it, since you can't continue.
I couldn't get into some of the admittedly important ""classics"" on this disc, however.  Robotron 2084 must have been great in 1984, but with the nearly identical and much better Smash TV right here, what's the point?  Similarly, I don't think I'll be playing Defender too much when I've got games like Gradius IV in my collection.
There are a couple of stinkers on here, too.  Does anyone really enjoy Toobin' or 720?  And while Super Sprint is fun in the arcades, it's impossible to control with a joystick.
The thing that struck me most about this collection is how these older games are not for wussies like new games are.  If you don't know what you're doing, you'll lose all your lives in a matter of seconds.  Contrast that to newer arcade games, which usually let you play for a certain amount of time no matter how much you stink.
At any rate, I probably would be willing to pay the $19.99 cost of this game for Klax alone (I remember paying more for the Atari Lynx version of Klax and Nintendo's Marble Madness), so this was a no-brainer purchase.  However, what I really, really want is a collection of old NES games for GameCube... Metroid, Contra, Life Force, Mega Man, RC Pro-Am, Double Dribble, etc.  Nintendo, Capcom, Konami, are you listening?

But the quality of the graphics and the ease of navigation make up for it. Even a user who is not all that familiar with adventure games will be able to pick this one up and run with it in no time at all.
The puzzles are hard enough to be challenging, but not so difficult as to be impossible to figure out without hints or a walkthrough. I have resorted to hints only a few times, and it only confirmed that I would have been right to follow my instincts. Also, they are not at all abstract, but each is tied into the story and setting of the game, so they make even more sense if you think about it. Sometimes just wandering around will be enough to lead you to solve the puzzles presented.  Other times, the answer is simpler than you might think. But if you're an experienced adventure gamer you won't have much trouble with them.
The real pleasure here is the story and the character development. Your interactions with certain characters is crucial to how well and how quickly your progress in the game. in a sense you have a hand in creating your own unique version of the story. The cell phone is employed as a means of fleshing out the life of the main character outside the story, and serves to create some dramatic tension, though the resolution is somewhat expected.
The only other drawback might be the lenght of time it takes the character to get from one point to another (there doesn't seem to be a way to get across Valladilene instantly, for example), but at least the scenery makes the trip seem more worthwhile.  Finally, the only other negative I can think of about this game is that it's too short!  By the end of the game I was left wanting more.  But then I supposed that is the mark of truly good work on the part of the creators.  I understand Syberia II is in the works.

Even if that is the best thing it's got going for it... well that and the dismembering spinning disc of death that's attached to your arm.  You know, that old thing.

Visually, this game is very tight.  The bleak, grey, stone walls that surround you.  The faded yellow of the soldiers' bio-suits.  The slick, metalic, gunmetal black with blue tints of the infected enemies.  It's a color palette that's tight without being boring-- which is saying something when your three primary colors are grey, charcoal, and freaking BLACK.  Its all pulled together by haunting music and ambient voices (I still here the scracthy voice box of those creepy Russian soldiers in my head from time to time) to create a one of a kind environment that's memorable, noteworthy, and lots of other positive things.

Unfortunately, gameplay will trump visuals any day (it is a game, meant to be played afterall), and that's where darkSector starts to trip up. ...that and a middle-of-the-road story that is serviceable and ultimately forgettable and probably not even worth mentioning (super-virus, bad russians, government cover-up, blah blah blah).

You've got a good variety of enemies to deal with, ruthless and deadly enemies who will murder you to the point of frustration.  So it's dissapionting that your bio-enhanced super-soldier is kind of a spaz.  He sticks to walls unreliably, he's not too quick on his feet.  It's not a crippling problem, but does make the tougher points more frustrating than they needed to be.  Where it really unravels, though, is in your lack of self-defense options.  You've got a decent amount of guns to pick from, and your glaive (oh, that glaive!) but everything worth using is middle distance.  Sniper rifles are all but useless and melee... well, I wouldn't bother with it other than to go in for some of the (beautifully brutal) instant kills: anything else is suicide.  So you're spending the entire game either machine gunning or dual wielding a pistol and the glaive (!)  trying to keep the baddies at an awkward middle-distance.  Too far away?  They'll pick you to pieces.  Too close? Splat!  It's a frustrating little dance that makes you feel impotent more than immortal and that shoots fun in the knee and dares it to get up.

But when it's fun...  Can I talk about the Glaive?  Just for a bit?  Brutal, man, and worth sitting through anything else you don't like.  Frustrating enemy in cover?  Bounce that thing off the wall behind him and watch the blood fly.  Bad guys all lined up?  Let 'er rip and see how many heads you can take off in a row.  Charge it with electricity and watch 'em dance to death from the slightest touch.  And try, TRY not to grin as they run and SCREAM in slow motion when they see that spinning death coming.  Try, TRY not to laugh when you catch his arm and it GOES FLYING!  It's an incredibly satisfying physics-driven attack and the only time you get to truly feel awesome in darkSector.  It's so successful, actually, that I'm suprised I haven't seen a few clones of it tucked into other games.

Still, though: only a middle-distance weapon. ::Sigh::","Deep & Dark... well, not so 'Deep', really...",1309910400,2,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

I enjoyed it, which, though I finished 4, is a long stretch because of the ""grid"" system having been so darn slow-paced in 4, in this one it is sped up considerably making it feel a lot more like a western than a bad tactics' game.

For those who like the first 2(even the 3rd) Wild Arms, story-wise this one finally picks up what was missing in 4 and gets it quite well done by the pacing and character followings'.

Unfortunately, like all the recent Wild Arms', the ending will not leave you ""Happily Ever After"" as the first 2, think more along the lines' of the pace that 3 set, not depressing entirely but not entirely satisfying, which is both good and bad.

This game is well polished overall , but it has its flaws. First off the load times are ridiculous. The communication is horrible. Other than me starting a chat party with people i already know, its hard to find people that will want to do exactly what you want to do. Yes you can do missions alone, but for a MMO, id like to play with random people. There needs to be a matchmaking room to allow this. The AI's take cover well and move toward you to attack, however you can run away and just regenerate, rinse and repeat. All enemies for the most part are bullet sponges. Its just too easy. The one thing that gets most people is they expected way to much out of this game. They marketed the hell out of this game to make it seem EPIC. Its not EPIC. Dont get me wrong im enjoying the game and getting my moneys worth out of it, but i won't be playing this game within a month. The storyline is non existant, the grinding is ridiculous and the 3 characters you choose from are pretty much the same. The guns are not really different from the next, upgrading is boring and the game is just redundant. I found myself in the same areas doing the same thing over and over. I went into MP and had  great time playing it. Not sure if it was balanced correctly, but you are allowed to take your weapons into MP. I enjoyed the MP, and strikes the most so far. The maps are simple enough to get a lay out after a game or two. Overall Destiny is not the best game out there, but its a decent game to have a good time. I feel this game was half done.

I had to pay for the shipping back to the manufacturer to get a replacement because the USB on it didn't work anymore and a couple keys were already not working or barely working. I've only had they keyboard 4 months. This was a great keyboard but to be first manufacturing line out and the first problem I have is keys not working... that's a bad sign. I don't know if the USB ever worked but I didn't have a need to use it until a few weeks ago. No working USB, no big deal. Having keys like 's' and 'backspace' stop working is a huge deal.

In short, I paid top dollar for a high end gaming keyboard. It failed on the S key. Meaning no more backpedal and no more gaming. The backspace also became problematic. The USB stopped working. This keyboard was expensive. I expect better. Especially if I have to pay $8 to ship it back for replacement.

I just received this keyboard yesterday and since there are no reviews, I'm sure people are holding out to know if this keyboard is any good. Well, it is to a point. It's backlit blue, there is no other color option just so you know.

Pros:
It looks sleek and shiny. The finish is very shiny and polished like some new HDTVs you see.

The backlighting on the keys look really nice and well lit. It'd very subtle on all the keys and looks like the keys are naturally glowing instead of being lit. When the backlighting is off it just looks solid black, which is cool. The keys won't light when on standby or powered off.

The keystroke is somewhat short, which I kind of like. It's halfway between a standard keyboard and a laptop's keys without being too close.

There is a macro program you can use to change key functions, disable keys, and enable macros that automatically activate when you start certain games. Best use, you can turn off the windows button or any other button you want.

You can enable just WASD lighting on your keyboard for gaming, which actually helps a lot.

Cons:
The glaze mixed with short keys adds to typos. It might just take getting used to as I moved from a standard keyboard with huge keys to this.

While the backlighting is great, the lighting on the Caps, Num, Scroll buttons is incredibly bright. I wish you could disable just certain lights, but you can't. In fact, you can't even turn it off unless you turn num off and so on.

If you're used to knowing where you are on the keyboard by the bumps on F, J, and 5... you might have a hard time. They are very slightly raised.
The up arrow and left arrow are flush with the keyboard while the other two are slightly raised. This is a bit annoying for now.

Fingerprints fingerprints, EVERYWHERE! Yeah, it's a problem if you care about it. You only notice it in a well lit room. I can barely see them in my office and if you're in the type of lighting where backlit keyboard would be needed, you probably wouldn't notice them. They did include a nice microfiber cloth for ridding of your smudges.

Concerns:
Will this wear down? I worry that the glaze might wear off because I've never had a piece of electronics with this glazed look that I actually constantly touch.
The lasting period of the backlighting. I couldn't find any info on this. While it looks way more solid than competitor keyboards, all lights burn out eventually.

Conclusion:
I have not found any of the problems in this keyboard that most people had in their other razer keyboards. I actually like this keyboard quite a bit, the only problems I have are getting used to the keys and that annoyingly bright num lock. It does have a mic, headphone, and USB jack in the back of it. While the USB is helpful, I have surround sound so the headphones and mic are not. Both of those items plug directly into my system.

You can't see it but the ports are above the pause and scroll buttons on the back of the board. The board also has legs to prop it up slightly higher, not high enough I think as it barely makes a difference. The cord is slightly longer than a standard keyboard and the extra ports cords are all given enough rope to let you plug them in comfortably.","Nice, sleek, had to be replaced on my dime",1229126400,6,{'Style:': ' Special Edition'},"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31r5M9M8mwL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/415y5oORpKL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/410sBWn-a3L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41tL+jiSoYL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41k6hqGok6L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41iqUQCuKbL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/418ylNTWvcL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/418UyCLvITL._SY88.jpg']"

Story and immersion are at their best in FFXI, and even the most popular MMORPGs don't compare in that regard. Vana'diel is a very special place full of interesting enemies, zones, and challenges.

However, gameplay is optimized for consoles, and the game hasn't changed much in regards to controls since it launched nearly a decade ago. Playing with a keyboard & mouse is almost unbearable, so a controller is practically necessary. Even then, combat isn't as enjoyable as in more modern games. The one shining light is that playing in groups is extremely satisfying. Finding people to party with, and then adventuring to level up together is time consuming, but very rewarding.

The visuals have aged well given this game's age, and the audio is outstanding. The UI is very unorthodox, and takes some practice to get used to, but it works.

This latest package, Ultimate Collection Abyssea Edition, is very helpful for beginners. The beret code included aids significantly in leveling in the beginning, and the additional content comes at a great price.

Final Fantasy XI is a bit dated, but its shortcomings are met with its outstanding visual and audio qualities accompanied by the awesome stories found within.

You don't shoot anyone, there's no fancy 3-D graphics, no dungeons or dragons or spells, nothing blows up...all hail the DOS-yuppie god!

Until yesterday I wasn't aware that gaming companies were still in the business of making PC games for people who had IQ's of over 80.  In fact, I haven't seen a strategy game this thoughtful and educational since Civ II.  The game's premise is simple enough.  You are running for president of the United States and you have to win over each state during a 10 month campaign.  You must make a special effort to get the ""swing states"".

You can play as Bush or Kerry, or even create a character and play through a campaign mode.  The game is thoughtful and contemporary; tackling hot current issues.  It is realistic as well as you WILL be tempted to lie in certain states on heated topics (ie: war in Iraq) to get the vote.  But you WILL be taken to task by the media if you cross up your lies.  No bull, you must be clever to win this game.

You can stage smear campaigns and make TV appearances. You must collect endorsement from interest groups based on your political stance. The game is incredibly realistic.  However, the real clincher here is that it has tons of educational value as well.  If you don't understand political concepts, such as the electoral college or swing-votes, you most certainly will after playing this game.  You'll also understand why politicians lie so much!!!  It's part of the game, baby!!!

I'd give this one five stars for realism alone.  I'd also send it 5 stars for pure unadulterated educational value.  The only 3 cons here are a poorly written manual, poor font and an built in element of planned obsolescence.  On the first point, the manual really should be better - or the game should have a built in tutorial.  With reagrd to the second, I don't know how many times I'll have to say this before I die so here I go again: HEY, SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS - STOP MAKIN THE DARN FONT THAT MAKES YOU GO BLIND!!! (There, I said it - now I feel better).

Finally, with regard to the element of obsolescence.  I think whoever designed this game was clever enough to realise that there is a select few people who will want more from Policial Machine. A case in point is that even in fantasy mode, the only two parties allowed are democrat and republican.  You can't create your own party.  For instance, I know some people who want Michael Moore to run for Prez.  Some of you lunkheads will also want to run Nixon again.  Of course, JFK or FDR might even make a comeback if theres a Political Machine 2!!

Unfortunatly, I don't think that this will happen.  As more and more companies continue to pound out action shooters for X-Box and Playstation 9-year old kids, thoughtful strategy games like the Political Machine are becoming increasingly rare.  I can just see this game being discontinued and sold at an Amazon Z-shop 5 years from now at 50 bucks a pop.

Then, I picked up a copy of Morrowind, spent about 200 hours playing this open-ended RPG, and realized that the xbox didn't need an MMORPG.

As far as gameplay goes, this game takes on a FPS approach.  Leveling up depends on how often you use the skills you have alloted.  Not only that, you don't have to learn spells, you can buy them in different shops around the game world.

The world of Morrowind is standard RPG fare, filled with elves, dwarves, sprites of all kinds and is all emcompassing.  Basically, folks, if it's in any sort of RPG, you'll see it in Morrowind.

2088,4.0,False,"01 2, 2006",A3SNO7AAYOXQUN,B00000I1BJ,Avatar of the Llama,"My first experience with the Resident Evil series was with Code: Veronica X.  I was severely disappointed overall with it, and from what I've read, the whole series is the same, so I had little to no faith in it.  I didn't feel the need whatsoever to play the other games, and openly spoke out against the series, even though I only played one game.  But, after playing Resident Evil 4, I got intrigued by the story, so I decided to try out Resident Evil 1-3.  I thought, ""There's no way they can be worse than Code: Veronica, so why not?""  And good god... was I right.

Although the first RE was little more than a big laughable joke (thanks to the ridiculously horrible voice acting that makes what you find in Code: Veronica X look like an Oscar-winning performance), that wasn't really scary at all until the hunters came into the picture, the second iteration really blew me away.  Anybody who has known me for more than two seconds knows I don't care at all about graphics in a videogame, so I'm not going to say anything about them because it is irrelevant (which is why I'm not a GameCube or Xbox fan).  The gameplay is very good for a survival horror - there is plenty of puzzle solving, adventure, exploration, and combat to keep the interest level up.  That's what I like about survival horror: it's not just about fighting to stay alive, but it is also about exploring and solving puzzles to unravel the plot and make sense out of mysterious circumstances.  And, while Resident Evil 2 isn't anywhere near as scary or intricate in story as the Silent Hill series, it is still a top-notch game to play for any fan of the genre, and I highly recommend it.  The first one you can play on your own; I just played it because I wanted to know what Wesker did to get Chris so ticked off with him, and vice versa.  The reason the title of my review is ""I was wrong..."" is because I really was wrong in assuming that the Resident Evil series was a bunch of bunk and no worth anyone's time.  So, I apologize for being a presumptuous jerk.

But, there is one issue I just can't stop from addressing: the controversy over the control scheme.  Now, I won't go into one of my trademark rants insulting everybody, but I will state my thoughts from an objective point of view.  The reason survival horror games have such awkward controls is because the game developers wanted it that way.  This is a genre for puzzle solving, plotlines, exploration, and thought, not just about shooting things.  They made the controls this way to render it, in a way, a sort of ""anti-action"" type of game genre.  Still, though, once you get used to the controls, like me, you will have no trouble blasting zombies torsos in two soon enough.

Another thing that is cool about this game is the zombies and their... ""creative"" death sequences (okay, so maybe they die a second time, but this time for good).  Naturally, you can blow their heads off, but even more possibilities await your execution.  Sometimes, you can fire at them and their arm will be severed by your bullets, or with a shotgun you can shoot them at the base of their spine and they will be blasted in half, the upper section of their body crawling on the ground with its arms alone to try and bite you.  When you upgrade your shotgun later on, you can actually blow their chest in half!  And, with a rocket launcher, if you fire at them square in their torso, their arms, head, and a good portion of their upper body will be gone.  If you hit them to the right side, most of said side will be gone, as will their head and respective arm, yet their left arm will still be attached.  Pretty cool, huh?  Code: Veronica X didn't have anything like that, which is rather too bad.

The only problem I had with this game, and it really isn't a problem with the game itself, is that it really made me shake my head at Code: Veronica X.  It almost seems as if Capcom had taken a huge step backward in their videogame-making abilities.  Heck, even the first Resident Evil is better than REC:VX.  For example, in the first one, the hunters had narrow, sharp, reptilian eyes, rows of razor-sharp teeth that protruded from their mouths, and they looked pretty scary, but in Code: Veronica, they didn't have such teeth (it almost looked like they didn't have any at all), and they also had small, beady eyes, making them more of a joke than an intimidating enemy.

Yet another good part about this game is the Titan.  I must say, he is really one heck of a bad guy.  But, of course, he's nowhere near as bad*ss as the Nemesis or as terrifying as Pyramid Head.  But he's cool nonetheless.

So, in conclusion, if you like survival horror games, then I suggest you try this one out.  But don't expect it to be better than Silent Hill, if you're a fan of that series (just as a side note).",I was wrong...,1136160000,,,

As you may, or may not know, your adversary in the 'game world' sends you back in time to the 80s, to play game challenges in order to return to the present.  You actually play alongside him, in his house, on his gaming system, but he's a child of course, and has no knowledge of his future self, until you show up.  There's a lot of humor in the dialogue, but I won't spoil any of it here.

You recieve 'new' games, new gaming magazines, new challenges.  If a game is giving you trouble, your character can scoot on over to the bookshelf, thumb through a recent gaming mag, and get a hint, or a cheat, or just enjoy the humourous writing in the magazine.  There are some interesting nods to Die-Hard GameFan, and known gaming editor Dan 'Shoe'.

Your enemy-to-be sits beside you on the living room floor, makes comments on your playing, responds to his mother...  Okay, they've taken a huge part of my youth, and stuck it in a video game.  Now I'm hooked.  The presentation is brilliant.  Right down to your character walking on his knees to the bookshelf, or to the system to pop in a new game.

We ( me and my circle of friends ) did the exact same thing!  We used to scan our favorite magazines for cheats, tips and tricks.  We had no internet to help us out.  We used to rally together when one of us picked up a new game.  Make comments when it was the other guy's turn, etc. etc.  Rejoice in gaming accomplishments.  They've captured the atmosphere of gaming in the 80s perfectly.

The games themselves seem to all be knockoffs.  Done well enough for you to instantly recognise the inspirations, you will feel as though you're actually playing classic gaming goodness.  The story, and presentation is brilliant, and the humour is well thought out.  On the whole, a very well-rounded, pleasant surprise.  ...so far.  I honestly can't imagine this title taking a nose-dive later in the game, though.

Something parents can play with their children. In my (admittedly short) experience playing Infinity 3.0, this playset is probably the best example of that notion. Inside Out is straight-up platform game where you collect certain things (manual pages, idea bulbs etc...) and meet certain objectives (pop all the balloons, meet certain time requirements...) to finish the game. On top of that, some objectives require the specific ability of one of the characters (Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust) to achieve.  Keep in mind though, you don't need to buy all the Inside Out figures to finish this playset. The game cleverly works around this by allowing you to transform into other characters at certain times when needed so you can achieve 100% completion whether you have one or all the figures. I have 3 of them (Joy, Anger and Disgust) and I'm thinking of getting them all anyway as they are quite beautiful, detailed and collectible in their own right. Disney did a great job of making the characters in this set unique, even though they share similar abilities. My daughters have taken ownership of their favorite characters and both Joy and Disgust get a lot of play in my house.

Gameplay is platform at its most basic. If you have played Mario or Crash Bandicoot, you know what I'm talking about. The game takes place in Imagination Land, which is part of Riley's brain. There is a lot to see and the developers milk the concept for all it's worth. You will see killer broccoli, giant flip flops and flying Oreos among other things. There are also some puzzle solving elements that help break the continuous platform jumping.

Bear in mind that I play this game exclusively with my daughters who are 7 and 5 years old respectively. I am yet to play it by myself so if you are a seasoned gamer your experience may vary. A lot. Having said that, I love traversing through the pretty levels and working out the challenges and puzzles with my daughters. It takes us several passes at a level to get all the goodies. For example, I might try to get all the balloons in the level or I might try to finish in under 7 minutes, which is the time challenge, but I can't do both. This is absolutely no problem as my kids love to play in there and fight the broccoli, watch the unicorns and all the silliness that's going on. Not to mention watching the characters react. The game truly seems to excel when being played by more than one person.

While not as deep as most platform games out there, I think this is plenty fun and a perfect demonstration of what players can be able to create with Disney Infinity 3.0. If you have younger kids and are looking for something to do on family night, look no further than this. You will have a lot of fun.",Gaming for the whole family?

I'm now taking a break from the continuous trigger pulling and playing some of these hybrid RPG/FPS games. Did the Fallout series and tried Metro 2033 when it hit a sweet price point. I then heard of STALKER and saw Amazon had some pricing that got me the whole set for what I would spend at a good movie theater.

STALKER SoC was a nice atmospheric game and the sensory programming was pretty good. Clear Sky matches the mood and seems more like a flashback episode than a separate game but I like how it fleshes out the storyline. The audio and visual programming had some real power to draw you into the environment. In comparison Fallout seemed pretty stark and desolate, leaving me mentally dry and parched after playing.
Some people seemed to dislike the repair and upgrade features of CS but I prefer the realism aspect this enforces. There was lots of cursing when my gun would jam several times in a big gun fight. My wife would ask why I was playing a game that I cursed at regularly.

Well I don't see the draw of the Kardashians so we're even :-)

Since I do not like to replay games like this due to the large time investment the thing that bugged me a bit is the multiple choices one faced regularly. The choice one picks can be a dead end or sabotage other game play a long time from when the choice was made. I know I missed out on some artifacts and other bonuses because I did not follow the required order of activities. Unless you read the spoiler filled forums and guides it is pretty impossible to snag all the swag and achieve all the challenges. I'm not a swag addict but some of the items were key to growing the character's ability to face stronger opponents. Don't know what the answer is on that dilemma. I'm not in it for checking off items completed - too much like work ;-)

The program ran pretty good once I realized I had bought a fully patched version. Running the latest patch on it broke it and I spent a day looking for the answer. My mega-doh! moment in gaming.

You set out to do something only to run into something else that looks interesting, and you think, ""I'll just see where this goes for a minute and then come right back,"" and five or six iterations later, you're on the other side of the continent with an incomplete recollection of the chain of events that brought you there. There's a lot of stuff to do, a lot of goodies to find, and a lot of creatures to kill. If you're a completionist, this game will keep you busy for quite a long time. I finished it in just under 70 hours.

Many of the game's mechanics will no doubt feel familiar, which is by no means a bad thing since they're implemented very well. The items you'll find in the game -- and there's a ridiculous variety of them -- follow the same sort of schema as in Diablo II. When you find something you don't need, you can either sell it or break it down into components which (with the requisite skills) you can recombine them into custom equipment. There are dozens of different reagents you can find which can be mixed in a vast number of ways to produce all kinds of potions. There are loads of skills and abilities to choose from as you develop your character, and if you don't like what you've done, you can reallocate those points and come up with a completely different character build, which is a nice option to have. Combat is handled nicely, with enough variety to keep it interesting even through the game's (potentially) very long play time.

The bad: The story is utterly forgettable, odd in a game which advertises the writer as a selling point. I've never read anything by Salvatore, so I can't speculate on whether fans of his will agree with me here or burn me as a heretic, but to me it's really missing the narrative strength and interesting characters that you'll find in, for example, some of Bioware's RPGs like Dragon Age or Baldur's Gate.

If you take the time to complete all the side quests and such, then by the time you reach the later stages of the game, the difficulty will have fallen off dramatically, even on Hard. The big showdown at the end of the game is a cakewalk, and the ending seems almost like an afterthought.

Well, let's just say the developers took the original design and amped it up a bit with some serious frenetic speed and visuals to match. What makes this game so special is its' three on three battles. The look and feel of the anime is definitely felt in this game, just as in Shin Budokai for the PSP. And, just as in that PSP game, this game will have you playing for quite sometime. Although, if you're expecting this game to be exactly like Shin Budokai, it's not. This is a Dragonball Z game that plays more like a Street Fighter game, in a 3-D environment. Control is good, although I would've loved for them to implement the DS touch pad into the gameplay more. The only thing it's used for in the game is swapping characters or summoning a team attack. At any rate, with the serious lack of fighting games for the DS at the moment, Supersonic Warriors 2 definitely holds the title for the best fighter for the DS thus far.

Like any game, though, it has it's share of flaws. Like players not being perfectly matched in the game, the fighting mechanics(punching and kicking) not being fleshed out enough, or the fact that you basically have to learn the ins & outs of the game before you get somewhere. Still, those flaws don't mar an otherwise perfect DBZ game. Production values were definitely high on this game.

Needless to say the xbox was the personification of gaming potential, with a graphics engine that far surpassed any of the competition, it seemed emminent that the xbox was the next best thing in gaming, however, it was not to be.  With a line up of lack luster games and a backing company that seemed to care much more about the mighty buck than the consumer, the x box was a system that could not meet its potential.  Now, however, is a new era, and gaming is not the same as it once was, and with the coming of the new age microsoft has decided to pull out the big guns.  The xbox 360 is an improvement on the old in every aspect of gamining, a more powerful graphics engine and a line up of excellent games make this machine ideal for anyones gaming needs,  i am not going to compare this system to the PS3 or to the WII because all three systems have their strengths and weaknesses, the ps3 has great graphics potential but so far the game line up has been terrible, the WII has inovativeness and is extremely fun but has lack luster graphics, and the xbox 360 is kind of the middle ground where it is not as powerful as the ps3 and not as fun as the wii but still manages to deliver a solid package.

GRAPHICS

As i said before, the visuals on this system are top notch,  when playing games like ghost recon or F.E.A.R. you truly get to appreciate the blood and brains that go splattering towards your screen when you hit with a well placed head shot, and with games like oblivion one gets to appreciate the ambient feeling of everlastin bliss that can only be obtained from visualising the most beautiful of environments.

So far there isn't a very large library of memorable games for the 360, so far the only 3 i really like are ghost reacon, fear, and oblivion, but i loved all three of those games and i dropped about 200+ hours of my life into oblivion so i cannot complain in that department, what really makes this system fun, however, is its online playability.  I'll tell you right now there is nothing quite so fun as calling up a bunch of your friends and killing eachother on an open internet network, throw that in with movie, game, and music downloads, and you have got yourself hours of fun.

HARDWARE AND PERIPHERALS

Here is where i feel the 360 really shines.  From extra battery chargers to alternate the battery on your controller so that your game is never interrupted, to an add-on hd dvd player, the xbox 360 has more neat gadgets than any other system on the market.  If you are thinking of purchasing a 360 however i will have to recommend that you purchase the system cooler, because this system gets hot!!!  Before i got the cooler, oblivion constantly glitched up, and it kept freezing on me, bur after i got the cooler running all my games run smooth as a baby's bottom, (not to say the cooler does look pretty cool).  On another note, if you have a high defenition tv and are looking for an inexpensive hd dvd player then look no farther, the 360 add on is a 200 dollar high defenition dvd player which looks great, and best of all, is completely optional, if you have an hd tv then get it, if you don't then don't. Finally i have to say something about the 360's wireless controller, it is one of the best peripherals for any system since the wave bird, it is the lazy man's greatest invention, now with the touch of a button on your controller you can start your system with out having to get your lazy a$# off of the couch.

PRICE

In the end if you get the xbox 360 and the hd dvd add on you would be paying just as much as if you bought a ps3 with the blue ray already installed, the difference, with the xbox you get the option of getting the add on if you want it or not.

In conclusion the xbox 360 is a great system with a lot going for it, i think it can hold its own pretty well against the competition (even if the wii is sold out everywhere, damn i want one), and it was the first next gen councel i purchased, so it will always have a place in my heart.

The difficulty is easily adjustable so I can enjoy it and my nephews can too (without them getting frustrated.) The different golfers look, for the most part, like their true selves and the golf courses look great.

 There are a few things that are really annoying though. Mainly, the crowd sometimes gets in the way of shots; if you are in the rough there are a lot of times where they just do not get out of the way and are in direct line for where you are hitting so you either have to take a route away from where you want to hit or drill it right into them (which is fun too since there are some funny animations for when you hit spectators.) I have also had problems where, for no apparent reason, the sound in the game will go out; this is the only game this has happened on and the only way to get sound back on is to quit the game and restart it (which wouldn't be so bad if you could save in the middle of a round.) And that brings up my last problem with the game; no saving in the middle of rounds.....not a game killer but it is annoying (edit: after thinking about this I can see why this is not included to prevent saves after every good hole; but it would be nice if you could save at the turn or something.)

You can also make choices throughout the campaign that effect your gameplay without effecting the linear plotline.  Some people saw this as railroading, but I think it's a fun way to add some customization.  Battle.net is a breeze to use and the multiplayer capability adds years of replayability.  Lastly, the graphics are top notch and fluid.

Are there any downsides to this game?  After playing it for hours on end, I really can't find any.  Sure, it lacks some features from the original Starcraft, but it's 2011, not 1998.  I still think it's a terrific game that you'll have fun with.  You'd be hard pressed to actually hate it.

When I 1st got the game I went right to Galactic Conquest I click on the 1st selection and I was fighting in space and was very excited until I got kill 15 times!! (most I ever died in Battlefront I was 4 times) then to top it off I couldn't shot down any ships, I became very frustrated!!! Then I exited the space fighting and went to Genoese to do land battle (which I know I'm expert at) then I was being killed there every minute and I had hard time understand were my life meter was, how to reload ammo etc... I was ready to give up on the game and understood why some people said Battlefront II isn't as good as Battlefront I.

Then I decided to started the game from the beginning and went through ""Training"" which is Very easy but that is where I learn how I can change my trooper in the middle of the game (without having to kill myself, is a great new feature!!) and how to use a Jedi, after the training was done I went to ""Over View of Space"" where it tells you to do ""Rise of the Empire"" Your on land at 1st, which is easy to accomplish but you learn how to take down shields and find object to take back to base or to a ship. Then your in space where it teaches you how to fly, how to lock on the targets, and how to fly into enemies hangers and blow up their ships. After completing all the task in the training & Rise of the empire, then I jump into Galactic Conquest and I did so Much Better and I now LOVE Battlefront II.

It's so much more challenging Then BFI, you can't accomplish BFII in one day, which I like!! BFI my 4yr old can play it and get score as high as me, but BFII is to hard for him as it should be. There are more troops & vehicles to choose from. And I don't understand why other say the graphic are bad, maybe they have cheap TV's. But on my 32"" flat screen TV the graphic are crystal clear for me, the planets have more detail and are almost real looking, the wookies look a lot better then they did in Battlefront I. There are so many more planets to choose from and fighting in space is a great feature when you get tired of doing land battles.

The best advice I can give: I don't care how good you are at Battlefront I, this is a Whole new game with different features so I suggest going through ""Training"" and ""Rise of the Empire"" before conquering the galaxy and you'll like the game much better I do.

I just picked this game up today, it is so much fun!!! I played through the training levels then asked my fiance if she wanted to try so she went through the training levels, then played for about two hours before I finaly asked if I get a turn. She hesitantly gave it up so I played for about an hour then made dinner. While I was making dinner she was playing it, I asked her to stir what was on the stove as I went down to the grill to put the meat on. I came back up she was still sitting there playing it and never stirred it. Then I went to take a nap before work because I work third shift and she said she played it until about a half an hour before I got up. The funny part is she really doesn't like or play video games... so needless to say it's pretty addictive!!!

There is a few different types of puzzles in this game. The first is to use a ball to knock down all the gems blocks in as little amount of throws as possible. The second is you grab the blocks and knock down the others for points, sometimes while avoiding blocks that minus points from you. There is also a Jenga style game where you need to carefuly remove blocks with out making something on top fall. The last threet I have come across are there are bombs that you need to make a chain reaction to take out the blocks in as few throws as possible.the There is also void blocks and chemical blocks. The void blocks disapear dropping any block on top of it off smashing it on the ground. The chemical blocks you need to combine two together to make a chemical reaction.

Sounds easy right? Not at all there are a lot of really challenging puzzles in this game from what I have read there is almost 400!!!
It's a really fun game that makes you try to examine the puzzles from different angles and try to complete the puzzle with the least amount of throws, the most points or or the quickest time. During the game you unlock new characters, levels, items, and things to design with.

The party mode is also really fun I only got to play the versus mode and the throwing game in it. You and the other players try to knock down the blocks hitting them into a multiplier wall that makes your score bigger depending on the amount you hit. My fiance and I had so much fun playing this mode together.

There is also a level builder mode that I haven't had a chance to play yet but from what I hear is alot of fun. I heard you can start from scratch or import a previously made level. When I play it I will update my review.

All in all this is a really fun game. Pepole of all ages can enjoy this game. I think it will actually replace Super Smash Brothers, Mario Kart and Wii Sports which my friends and I play a lot, so if you like puzzle games check it out!!!",so addictive it should be a drug,1215993600,3,,

As with the earlier Mario ports, the translation is flawless, and there are a few tweaks that bring it up to date for the GBA.
I first played this game and beat it many times, so sitting down to play it again was like riding a bicycle...you never really forget. I quickly adapted and remembered all the hidden portals, the hidden 1 ups, and all the extra perks that made this game so much fun. As far as the port goes, it is very similar to the one on ""Super Mario All Stars"" for SNES, but with the graphics and music slightly pumped up. The game itself needs no introduction, except for the fact that it is one of the best video games of all time. The challenge, the new improvements made on an old concept (remember, this game was a product of the late 80's video game craze), all the classic elements are still here. There are some who would complain that the GBA is just a portable SNES, but what is the problem with that? It is great to this game made available for a whole new generation.
The minor quibbles I have are nothing to do with the gameplay itself, but with the ""extras"" that are included. For starters, the addition of the original arcade version of ""Super Mario Brothers"", which is the exact same one they have included on the other two Mario ports on the GBA. It would be nice to have different games to play as extras, and the same game gets pretty tiring after a while. The other annoyance is the horrible voice characterizations in the game. Mario, in his cheesiest Italian accent, says ""Mama Mia!"" when he dies, and ""Just what I needed!"" when he gets a power-up. These were amusing for about 2 seconds on the other Mario ports, and are just annoying now after hearing them a million times!
This is so far the best NES/SNES port to the GBA, and I had no hesitation about purchasing it again, despite knowing the game like the back of my hand. For any fan of classic gaming, this is essential. For the uninitiated, Mario never got better than this, so this is essential! Highly recommended.",Classic Mario never looked better!,1071532800,5,,

The story is pretty standard Harvest Moon stuff, play as either a boy, (Mark) or a girl, (Chelsea) plant crops, build your dream house, and court your favorite bachelor/bachelorette until you've grown close enough, and get hitched. The only difference this time is that your character gets ship wrecked with your fellow passengers on a remote island, and it's up to you to make this island a great place to live for yourself & everyone else who wrecked on the island!
Eventually, once your ranch/farm gets into good condition and you've turned the abandoned island into a thriving community, people will actually begin moving to your island.

Now comes the subject of the controls...
At first, (being so used to D-Pads & Thumb Sticks) the controls were a little hard to get a handle on, but once I'd gotten used to them, I wouldn't have them any other way!
The touch screen is very responsive, (even on my old DS) and it makes organizing the items in your Rucksack, planting/harvesting crops, talking to your neighbors, and walking around the isle a snap!

The graphics look beautiful in Island of Happiness, they remind me alot of Harvest Moon: Magical Melody for the GameCube. They're very bright, well detailed, and fully 3-D! Animations on screen are all very smooth, unlike past Harvest Moon games like A Wonderful Life where everything's kind of ""warpy"" if you will.

Best of all, Island of Happiness is free of any annoying glitches, so you can play the game without fear that your save data will become corrupted and all your hard work will go down the drain...

In short, Harvest Moon: Island of Happiness is not to be missed! It is easily the best DS game I bought all year! (And I bought Final Fantasy IV DS!)

And if you still don't think you'll like the new controls, then wait for the US release of ""Harvest Moon: Shining Sun & Friends"" is a remake of Island of Happiness that came out in Japan last Febuary, complete with option to switch the controls so that you can use the D-Pad and A, B, X, & Y buttons instead of the touch screen.",A must own DS game!,1221004800,6,,

There are fast and slow attacks that can be linked as a combo for different effects, and there's a lot of leaping and diving to throw into the mix as well. In addition to melee weapons like a sword, a staff, claws, and a scythe, Ryu also has a few ranged weapons as well - shurikens (regular and exploding) and a bow. Finally, Ryu has certain magical abilities like fireballs and cutting winds to attack his enemies with, though their use is limited. His enemies range from ninjas - armed with equipment similar to Ryu's - to demons, large and small.

The gameplay is smooth, but fast and unforgiving. Your enemies attack ferociously and without mercy - no fair-play ""one on one"" duels here, your enemies will be doing their absolute utmost to make Ryu die. Human enemies (the ninja) have a wide variety of ""abilities"", for lack of a better word, that differentiate them from other random grunts in other games. The ninjas in Ninja Gaiden can lose limbs (arms or legs) and keep fighting - and this will happen a lot, be assured. Heavily injured enemies will try to grab on to Ryu and detonate their bomb as a last-ditch suicide attempt. Ninja types range from melee combatants with swords and claws to ranged types with bows and magic spells. Even without these skills, it's hard to keep up with their attacks, which require dodging, guarding, evading, and counterattacking to deal with - you can't just wade in and mash the attack buttons and expect to survive. The demons are even harder, being less predictable, depending on their type. Some are small, bat-like creatures that swarm Ryu faster than he can swing his sword, while others are hulking colossi that can grab Ryu and squeeze the life out of his body. There are bosses on every level as well - these enemies are generally much larger than any regular enemy, and their strength makes guarding useless, forcing Ryu to jump and dive for his life. Furthermore, they're not fazed by your attacks, requiring you to time your attacks so that you'll have time to escape before they counterattack. Overall, Ninja Gaiden is a relatively simple game in that it keeps the same basic premise for combat; there aren't really any segments that deviate from the established gameplay.

As a whole, the controls are good and also notably responsive. In some other games, you have to adjust your timing to the game and pause between pressing buttons so that the moves you've inputted can be executed. In NG2, the game moves roughly about as fast as you push buttons - if you're smashing the buttons really quickly, then the moves will get executed really quickly. To give an example, Ryu has the ability to walljump between two adjacent parallel walls. At first I thought I had to adjust my timing to wait for when he landed; I quickly realized that I could just mash the A button and ascend as quickly as I tapped. The game really rewards you for having good reflexes, and tries not to hinder you as best it can. The only really annoying parts about the controls are the camera (which is kind of unresponsive at times) and sensitivity with regards to hanging on pipes and running on walls, both of which have to do with the camera (since running on a wall is ""running forward"", if the camera changes it can mess you up mid-run).

The graphics in the game are really good looking, though ""realistic"" isn't quite the word that I'd use to describe them. They're clearly fake, but it's on purpose, so even though the characters have flawless, one-tone skin with no wrinkles or anything, it looks good and like it was done on purpose. The in-game graphics are really good, too. Combat is quick and highly cinematic without distracting or detracting from the gameplay experience. The most notable detail is the bodies, which are persistent - kill a bunch of ninjas, and their bodies don't fade (not while onscreen, at least). Furthermore, I never thought I'd think of blood and severed limbs as being ""artistic"", but this game really has the prettiest blood sprays and dead bodies that I can think of. Blood splatters on walls depending on the angle that you cut, and you really get the feeling with this game that you're an absolute ninja murder-machine. One of the more impressive details is the blood that accumulates on your blade - when a fight is over and Ryu stands idle for a few seconds, he whips the blood off the blade (throwing an extra splatter onto the floor) and re-sheathes it.

The sound in the game isn't particularly notable, except that the sounds of combat are really well shown - the clangs and screams, in addition with the music, create a mood-setting level of background noises that keep you in the action. The music in general doesn't have any tracks that are particularly good, though.

As a whole, Ninja Gaiden 2 is a really fun game to play - one of the first games in a while that really feels like a game and not just an interactive story. Flimsy demon-based story aside, Ninja Gaiden 2 is really just an excuse to kill a bunch of ninjas and demons with fancy moves and look really awesome while doing it. The only real problem is that the game is so hard that it might be intimidating to casual players, but for players with good reflexes and a strong will Ninja Gaiden 2 offers nothing but good, fun gameplay.

It is both an RTS (real-time strategy) and an RPG (role-playing game)game. There are four unique races; the humans, orcs, night elves, and the undead. You will have to master these races in order to survive. To succeed, you must create highly-trained warriors, destructing heros, plan out crucial attacks on your enemies, just to survive. Like I said, it has RTS and RPG game types combined, basicly StarCraft meeting Diablo (think someone mentioned that earlier, sorry). Even though I mostly play multiplayer, the single player is just great to start on once you get the game! For those of you who just can't stand multiplayer, and simply love those single player stories and enjoy a challenge, or for just you people with really bad internet connections, Warcraft III is perfect for you. It has an immense storyline with in-game cinemetics so you don't have to waste your time reading briefings, full magical quests, optional mission objectives, and great graphics and gameplay. Now, time to talk about multiplayer capability. Warcraft III has multiplayer capability, that means you can play online with your friends, or people you don't know. You can battle on Blizzard's enhanced Battle.net, which is a match-making multiplayer service, so you can have insane chaos battles. The game can get a little laggy if you have a bad a connection, or playing with people who have bad connections. I have a cable modem and I mostly have a 1on1 battle with my best friend, who he has 56k internet connection, but is getting a cable modem soon. Anyway, the multiplayer is just fantastic. You can trade resources with your teamates, have tough computers on your team, cast magical spells to attack or defend yourself using heros, just about anything you can think of you would expect from Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. Well, I don't want to bore you with this review, and I provided as much information as I possibly could. The bottom line is, Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos is the best game from Blizzard in my opinion, great single player campaigns and awesome multiplayer chaos on Blizzard's new enhanced Battle.net. If you have a pentium III or pentium 4, or higher, I suggest you get Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos.

I played it for about 5 hours yesterday and for a 1CD game, I was surprised at the level of the graphics and content from this game. Novalogic has affiliated themselves with NVidia and this is a bit of a dissapointment for me because I use an ATI GC and I work at ATI, but even on my ATI 9800 Pro, the game looks sweet and runs like butter. I was also impressed with the level of control and realism in this product. For example, you have to calibrate sniping distance using binoculars and then adjusting your crosshairs accordingly. The mortars, grenade launchers, etc.. work off the same principles.
The foliage is rendered brilliantly, even better than BF Vietnam, and I love BF. When shells or bullets hit water, the effect is simply amazing. Flying around in the copters was a lot easier to learn than in BF or Desert Combat. Novalogic decided to keep the flying vehicle controls simple and this is fine with me. Also, it took a bit of an adjustment to get used to the controls, but trust me if you do thee training missions, they become a snap to learn.
Try the demo out and then decide for yourselves if it is for you. Don't listen to too many critics...this game is top notch.

Pros
-Plays perfectly and saves.
-No issues with crashing or bugs
-Translation is grammatically good, no typos
-Fun game, but a little unbalanced (but that's not an issue with the product, just the game itself)

Cons
-Some of the characters have wonky names that I'm pretty sure aren't properly translated e.g. Geese, Milady(that's a name not a title), Wolt ( I think it's supposed to be Bolt), Treck, and Zinc. But given that the official versions of FE games tend to have strange names as well, this might be correct.
-No box, which isn't a big deal for me, but the picture is misleading.
-Hangs on hard saving, which made me nervous, but the saves were always solid so It's just a bug with the software.
-DOES NOT SAVE BETWEEN TURNS. The other Fire Emblem games save after each character movement, basically to prevent save scumming and also to prvent data loss, but this homebrew DOES NOT. If you turn your game off without manually saving data will be lost. Whether this is a good or bad thing depends on whether you save scum or not.

The Tales series has never been too big in America, but many of the games within the series are a blessing. Tales of Vesperia is a great outing that many fans of the series may enjoy. If this is the first time you've ever played a Tales game, then Tales of Vesperia is a good game to start with.

Tales of Vesperia takes place in a world where blastia, magical properties, are used to protect the denizens from monsters. There are also knights who help out and protect the citizens of the world. You play as Yuri, a man who left the knights mainly because he didn't like how the government treated the people. Obviously, there's something else a foot. Something more that this powerful empire is hiding and as Yuri and company you're going to find out what it is.

Tales of Vesperia may not have an original storyline, but it's told very well. Much of the dialog is very well written and sprinkled with its own fluffy humor. What really helps the story standout as being something much more than it is, however, is the cast of characters. They're very well developed and as you play you'll become really attached to them. Each also has their own distinct personality to help them along and they have their own charms about them. To help character development you can also watch skits, which are basically conversations among the party and they're completely optional. They really add to the characters by giving you a glimpse into just what they're thinking. If there was anything about Tales of Vesperia's story that is a little troubling, it would be that perhaps there's too much story in some areas. You'll run from one town to another only to backtrack to a previous town only to realize it was all done for story exposition and that you didn't really engage in a lot of battles. Yet, while there's a lot of exposition, there's still plenty of battling to be done.

The Tales games have largely been known for their battle systems. Once a battle begins you control one of four characters. You can all run around freely and land blows akin to a hack and slash game. You can also perform special techniques called Artes which will cost you tech points. It's all very simple stuff and feels very similar to the Star Ocean games. It can feel like a button mashing affair at times, and certainly the beginning stages of the game can be that way, but as you get further into the game it becomes less about hack and slash and more about strategy. Bosses in particular can be a challenge, especially if you want to get all the achievements. Some bosses require you to do certain things in order to get the achievement for them.

While you control one character the game's AI makes it a point to control the other three. Surprisingly, the AI does a very good job of keeping your characters alive and using items on allies who need them as well as healing. You can also set certain strategies and customize it up to help out. Even better than that, the game has multiplayer. Up to four players can play, although only the first player gets to control what happens in the field. For all it's worth, though, the battle system is superb.

Finally, there are abilities. Characters can equip weapons that will teach them certain abilities. If they use the weapon long enough they'll learn the ability and be able to use it whenever they want, provided they have the skill points required to equip it. There's nothing difficult about learning Tales of Vesperia's battle system. It's all relatively simple and easy to pick up on. So even if you've never played a Tales game before, the battle system is easy enough to learn that it shouldn't give you any trouble.

Graphics wise, Tales of Vesperia is gorgeous and runs very smoothly. Most of the dungeons you'll travel to also look nice. The enemies and bosses are very detailed and the load times are incredibly fast. The character designs are perhaps the best part as every character stands out as their own. Music wise, the game has a lot of memorable tunes that stand out. There are a few forgettable tunes but much of it really fills the situation. Much of the dialog in the game is spoken and the voice acting is very good.

If you're a fan of the Tales series, this is a great game to add to that collection. If you've never played a Tales game before and you're curious about the series, this is a good game to start with. With its easy learning curve and character driven story, most RPGers will find Tales of Vesperia to be a real treat.",The Finest Tales Game,1219881600,107,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

As stated in the previous paragraph, you can now hit the traffic without crashing yourself.  This is called ""Traffic Checking"" and it is a very good method to causing your opponents to crash.  Have a rival hit a checked car or truck and they'll crash!

Another new feature is that the new levels in Revenge are now made for destruction.  Ramps, Shortcuts, and even barriers make for great crash sites.

Also, a new and revamped Crash mode is featured.  According to a Burnout ad, ""It's like golf... but with cars"".  For all of you new to the series, the objective of Crash is to cause a pile-up and destroy as many cars as possible.  You can now get a running start with a help of a meter similar to the one in Madden.

Another new thing is the addition of crashbreakers to crash mode and some races.  Have you ever thought of putting a bomb in your car?  Of course you haven't, but Criterion did.  Upon crashing in race, you can detonate your car with the touch of the B Button (you will lose all your boost if you don't hit a rival, however).  In Crash, you can use a crashbreaker after you crash enough cars.  When you see ""Crashbreaker in 5"", you have 5 seconds (or until you hit 100%) to charge your bomb.  Tap B to get the Crashbreaker meter up.  The higher the meter is, the better the explosion!

Burnout: Revenge is simply awesome.  Upon playing, I became instantly obsessed.  When I played Burnout 1, I thought it was crud.  This is the sign of a good sequel in Burnout: Revenge.",Take REVENGE On Your Opposition,1150502400,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox'},

Yoshi's Island shows a lot of evolution in Nintendo's oldschool games.  Although it is nothing like it's predecessor, a.k.a. ""Super Mario World,"" it still manages to maintain the feel of a traditional Mario game.

Yoshi's Island has a unique array of boss characters.  They each have different strengths and weaknesses, and there are two per world, which should make for an interesting challenge.  Although, in my opinion, they are quite easy.  Something else I like about Yoshi's Island are all the different enemies; there are dozens!  Each one is unique as well, and adds a lot of diversity to the game.

The graphics are some of the best I've seen for the SNES.  While they do look a little cartoony, they look like wonderfully hand-drawn canvas pictures.  The paralax scrolling is nice as well.  The music for each level is extremely catchy, like the jungle theme.

The story is also interesting; it takes place when Mario is a baby, and your mission is not to save Princess Peach--it is to save Baby Luigi from Kamek and Baby Bowser!

Overall, this is an extremely unique Mario game.  Not much else can be said except ""Wow.""  Please don't miss this game, you'll regret it if you don't buy it!",A game to be appreciated.,1145145600,16,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The BlackWidow Ultimate 2014 Stealth Edition is a pleasure to type on.  The matte keys provide just the right texture for tactility and do not smudge easily.  With Razer's orange keyswitches, the actuation force required to register the keypress is perfect, and my typing accuracy is significantly higher than it was on my previous Logitech Wave keyboard. You can feel the point when the keypress registers, but it's not excessive or annoying.  The tactile feedback alone has helped me prevent from bottoming out, significantly reducing Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI).

I've also tried the Rosewill rk-9000, the BlackWidow Ultimate 2014 (non-stealth) edition, the Logitech g710+, and others.  As a male with moderately large hands, the g710+ had far too little key spacing to my liking and strained my fingers.  The Cherry MX blue keyboards were nice but loud and required a bit too much force for extended typing sessions.

I bought a Wii wishing for a Star Wars game where I can wield a Lightsaber with the Wii-mote and use Force powers with the Nunchuk. Well that dream has come true! Thank God Krome Studios didn't copy the  next-gen versions, because this version feels more like Star Wars. The Wii version gets more film accurate powers like Choke and Force Telekinesis! There are a few other moves that are Wii exclusive as well including Force Maelstrom and Force Slam! There are directional attacks for the Lightsaber, so where ever your enemies are swing the Saber in that direction. You can even block Blaster shots back at enemies by holding the Wii remote horizontally! All the Force powers come from controlling the Nunchuk in various ways. This game actually lets you duel wield a Lightsaber and The Force! In this regard, controlling your character on screen is very satisfying. The real fun begins when you face characters that wield Sabers and Force powers like you do. Your Lightsabers will lock up just like the movies! Using Force powers on these foes will initiate their own lock ups. There are a few counter maneuvers that your character can perform in the heat of a Jedi/Sith battle.

The story is absolutely amazing. They brought in George Lucas himself to help write the story, and as a result you have a top notch tale or good versus evil. This story could very well be a film in itself.

The graphics are great. Your character looks exactly like Sam Witwer, the actor who plays Darth Vader's Secret Apprentice! Your Lightsaber sparks against other Lightsabers creating an awesome clashing visual effect! Force Lightning casts its own light in the environment. Smoke and explosions are left behind by your path of destruction. The Physics Engine is superb. There are many things to destroy besides your opponents.

The sound is great. Ben Burtt's Star Wars library is hard at work in this game. The voice acting is award-winning. The music compliments John Williams score and sets the proper mood.

The Wii gets a couple of exclusives beyond the extra moves. Krome decided that Wii owners needed more Unleashed for their buck and added a few levels. The Wii version includes a jaunt to the Jedi Temple, A visit to the seedy entertainment district of Nar Shadda, and finally a side adventure through Cloud City itself! To teach you the finer points of being a Force user, Krome has included an extensive training program. The training is not only fun, but informative. The Wii also has a Duel Mode, in which you and a friend/or enemy can battle each other using characters from the game and movies! All the moves and powers are present in the Duel Mode. There are nine different arenas to battle it out in, so the Duel Mode will extend the replayability after your finished with Story Mode.

No this game does not look or play like the next-gen versions, and it's more fun that way. There is no DMM or EUPHORIA, and it really never needed it. You can't push enemies through walls, but you can push them through statues and columns. The Wii version of The Force Unleashed is a must-own title on the console. If you ever wanted to rip debris off the walls and hurl it at Stormtroopers using the Force, this game is for you! The Force Unleashed is the definitive Star Wars experience on the Wii.

This port has many MINOR translation issues and a few MINOR names were changed from the Super Nintendo System (Snes) port. A few minor lines were changed and or removed all together but none the less the story stay's intact and still is rather interesting to the RPG fan.

The story is about a boy who meets a girls and the visit one of the boy's friends at the fair and a Time travel  adventure takes place from the distant Future to the distant Past all in a attempt to save the world.  There is many different actions you can do that can either help your adventure or can destroy your adventure, Some actions will help you in certain  spots while other actions will hinder you. There are many endings that come of these actions so in the end the choice can be yours.

The Graphics have stay much like SNES port and the sounds is also much the same.

There is a few changes but as far as ports go this one dose stay very close to what I recall from the SNES port.

If your new to RPG and or this game you may want to check it out first before you buy it to see if it fits your taste however if your a RPG/Sfi-RPG/Fantasy RPG fan then you will enjoy the nostalgia that still is a Awesome game.

But since it also includes Star Fox Guard, it feels worth a full price tag. I've got about four hours of playing Zero and about four hours of Guard. I've made a quick first run through Zero and am well into Guard. edit: I've got over eight hours playing Zero (about five hours solo myself and 3+ hours playing co-op with my son). We've got more time than that playing guard.

--Star Fox Zero--
So Star Fox Zero is real Star Fox game where you're often flying with the Arwing (your normal airship/spaceship) and sometimes other vehicles/ships. I love the ""chicken"" mode in that the Arwing can transform into a chicken (supposedly it's a dinosaur, but hey, it's a chicken). The drone vehicle is interesting and thankfully doesn't overstay it's welcome. The tank is fine. But the Arwing is awesome as always! There are also a couple of classic Arwings for unlocking with Amiibo, but I hear you can unlock them in game too.

The controls are weird and I wouldn't call it intuitive. The new control scheme lets you aim and shoot with gyro controls on the gamepad, while your flight direction is separately controlled on the big screen. I do think I can learn them, but I think it plays better as co-op where one person flys and one shoots. I don't think I have as much fun playing co-op with my son (I'm a control freak), but it's a great way for him to play with me and I really enjoy being part of his first Star Fox game. You can use classic controls for large parts of the game but not all. I think it's going to be a week or so of playing before I can really say if the controls are still odd or if they'll grow on me. I do think I can get used to it, but I'm never going to tell people how great the controls are.

It feels like a space adventure. I've seen better graphics on the Wii U. but Star Fox has always kinda had blocky designs--it's part of the style. The frame rate is pretty smooth. You're still on rails or stuck in a trench most of the time, but every once in a while the scenery opens up and at that point the game looks so much bigger or epic than any Star Fox game I've played before.

It's not a very long game. I've rushed through a first playthrough already. There's quite a bit of replayability: branching paths and secrets to find. My son loves playing co-op with me. I'm not sad about the length, but some are going to find it short. I've always thought Star Fox games ran about this length.

I'm not sure if I'd call it the definitive Star Fox, but it's a good star fox game and makes me wish we'd get new Star Fox games more often. Get beyond the controls, and it's a solid game.

--Star Fox Guard--
I think Nintendo also saw Zero as being short which is why they include Star Fox Guard. This is one of the most interesting games I've seen out of Nintendo in a long time. It's tower defense played through a camera system. You're in control of 12 cameras with guns.

My first run through Zero was without my kids, but I've always played Guard with my kids. You can certainly play Guard alone, but it can be played ""cooperatively"". My kids love pointing out when enemies show up in different cameras. They're really into it! It almost can be played as a party game.

You see all your cameras on screen at once and you switch between them to shoot from the cameras at waves of bad guys. You can unlock different types of weapons. So far I've been playing where the cameras can heal, but there's a survival mode that once a camera is destroyed by the bad guys that it's gone for good!

The difficulty ramps up slowly, but the level design is creative and keeps you coming back for more. You can also design levels and share them online. You can't build a level from scratch, but you can create enemy waves on pre-defined levels. I think the main draw is the 50 missions, but at least there's a little more to play with.

--Conclusion--
Overall, I like both games a lot. Zero is a standard Star Fox game with odd controls, but the game and gameplay are great if you can get past the controls. At least it's a real Star Fox game! Guard is unlike anything I've played before, and it's really cool! I think we're going to be playing both for some time, but at the moment the family is especially excited about Guard. edit: Ok son's favorite way may be co-op Zero with me, but the girls think Guard is the best.","Guard trumps Zero in many ways, but both are good games",1461283200,9,,

Now that that's out the way, I found this game to be fun and I thought it had an original twist to it with how the game played and progressed. For this review however I'll stick to the small list of things that people might not like about it: that it's a filler, the drop system, and the camera.

For starters, some people have reservations about this game because it's a ""filler."" Personally I don't mind fillers, especially in this case because it adds more to the overall story of the Kingdom Hearts Universe.

If you've played bbs than you should be used to the camera system. The camera style I used was to turn the camera with the L and R buttons. I did not use the circle pad pro so I can't so how much that may change things.

As for the drop system, that I didn't mind either. It made sure you didn't spend to much time using one character. While there are some automatic drop areas or parts where you have to drop to progress, for the most part you can postpone the drop for as long as you want with items.

So if you can get over those three things, you should love the game just like I have","A fun ""filler""",1347753600,,,

Because on the sixth day one of my Merlot modifed guests caught the wire on the supplied sensor and nearly hauled the WII off the entertainment center!  Imagine taking that one back to Best Buy for warranty!

The NYKO wireless sensor bar has given us a degree of freedom unheard of with the wired one.  We can place it anywhere now and not worry about people tripping over it (ok, I tripped over it too).

Sure it takes 4 AA batteries but if you have kids and are not already buying nickel metal hydrides for their toys then you are wasting your money!  I have tonnes of these batteries around and a half dozen chargers to keep them ready for action.  I am averaging around 20 hours of game play with a decent set of NiMh (1500 to 2200 MaH).

The auto off in 1 or 2 hours is also very handy.  If I tell the kids they have an hour to play this is perfect for keeping track if I get distracted with other tasks.

The story for the game is built on a what if: What if Ash didn't get sucked into the portal at the end of Evil Dead 2?  Ash is instead put in an insane asylum because no one believes his story, with the exception of his Lawyer Sally.  However, the head of the Asylum, Dr, Reinhard, has the Necronomicon, (the book of the dead for those who can't pronounce it) and plans to unleash the deadites upon the world.  He manages to open up a several portals between worlds and it's up to Ash to stop his plot.  But he's not alone this go around.  Joining him in this journey is the half man, half deadite Sam.  Sam is necessary for the journey as only he can close the portals.  Being a deadite means he cannot die, and the game allows you to exploit that to its fullest, but we'll get to that.  Personally, I feel this fits the ED canon very well and wouldn't have minded if it got made into a movie.

Gameplay wise, EDR is basically God of War with an Evil Dead paint job.  Ash has a small arsenal of weapons he can use to unleash pain on the baddies.  Three guns and three hand weapons, using one of each at a time.  Here's a quick rundown.

Pistol: The first gun you get.  It has a great firing rate and range, but damage is lacking.  Works great on weaker enemies but stronger enemies don't have much to worry about.

Shotgun: One half of the classic weapon duo from the iconic movies, you get it pretty early into the game.  The shotgun may not have the best range or firing rate, but up close and personal this baby makes mincemeat out of most enemies.

Rocket Launcher: This bad boy will send those deadites packing.  Where firing rate is concerned it has the least to offer, meaning it's not the best for clusters of enemies, but it has great range and is the leader of the pack where damage is concerned.

Chainsaw: The other half of the famous pair.  Only works in close range but is brutally effective, and even gets upgraded towards the end.

Harpoon: You get this near the middle of the game.  It grabs enemies that are a fair distance away and brings them to Ash, and from here he can inflict major damage.  Makes it easy to deal with those pesky out of reach enemies.

Flamethrower: Still a close range weapon but oh my goodness is it satisfying to use.  You can roast those deadites for some old fashioned bad guy barbecue.  You can also use it on Sam.

You can switch between the weapons on the fly, having the right combination of weapons is usually crucial for success.  It seems that Ash' attacks are smidge OP (overpowered) take into account that the guns have infinite ammo and you'll usually just mash buttons.  But there is an elaborate combo system and if you wanna play with it, you'll be glad to know the controls are responsive.

Now I mentioned Sam, and how his lack of true death can be exploited.  You're going to have to use and abuse him to complete the mission.  It even says it on the back of the box.  You often need to kick him to activate things and make it possible to progress, to deal with out of reach enemies (until you get the Harpoon at least) and I'd be lying if I said I never kicked him just to kick him.  Sometimes you even possess him to open the way for Ash, which usually ends in him getting killed in a hilarious way.  It kinda gets repetitive, but doesn't overstay its welcome.

There is one more trick up Ash's sleeve: Evil Ash.  Basically the game's Rage Mode.  When activated you hit harder and take less damage.  Good for when you get in a pickle.  Also scattered throughout levels are hidden extras and pads that increase the life and rage meters.  The extras are just little goodies sprinkled in for ED megafans, but the latter two are very helpful and you should seek them out.  There are not that many but they're well hidden.  Regarding difficulty, the game can be a bit tricky and cheap at times, but most of my deaths were from not knowing what to do, or getting overwhelmed.  There are no checkpoints but the game does feature save points scattered through the levels.

The game has a dark sense of humor, but I got a few good laughs.  Evil Dead fans will feel right at home.  Part of me wonders if actual writers from the movies wrote the plot.  For voice acting, the man himself Bruce Campbell returns to play Ash, and Sam is voiced by Ted Raimi, brother of ED creator Sam Raimi.  The visuals look dark and creepy, fitting the vibe very well, and the music is...interesting.  When you possess Sam, the music is kind of odd and will be stuck in your head long after you want it there.  Turning into Evil Ash strums off a metal song that fits very well, and the music in between is dark and somber, but overall forgettable.

In the end, should you pick up this game? Absolutely.  The game is a ton of fun, easy to pick up, and is a great gift for that Evil Dead fan in your life.  If you can find it cheap, I say go for it.  Despite the few flaws it has, it's well worth seeking out.","A great Evil Dead game, even for non Evil Dead fans.",1498003200,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

I never completed the game because there were a number of titles I was working on at the time and it just fell through the cracks.  I recently was going back through my game library to play some of the older games I have and when I started playing this again I was taken back by how good the game is and how good the graphics still appear 3 years later.

It is a huge improvement over the first title, and if you haven't played the series before, it is worth picking up the older titles to play through before the latest installment is released later this year.  The game is a decent length.  A tip if you like going after achievements/trophies - there is one missable trophy during the play through.  Make sure you kick a guard while using the flying machine.

I used it for the first time yesterday and woke up today with some SORE muscles from the amazing cardio workout I got!  I'm 42 and know that as soon as I let my kids have a try, they will blow away my high scores on everything I've done, but for now, I'm the queen :)  They probably will be able to coordinate their feet better than I have, I tend to find myself slowly jumping off of the mat during jumping games, since I'm looking at the tv, not my feet.  But I know with more practice, I'll improve.

I love that you can use your own Mii to play the games, but the Mii is beefed up with cool clothes and shoes and the Mii body changes based upon what game you're playing (it moves more like you're moving, rather than a cartoon).

Lots of fun games that not only require a lot of cardio exercise, but some of them require teamwork in order to win - if you don't work with your partner, you'll both fail.

It's a very different workout, but definitely one that will bring results if you keep at it - and you get to have fun at the same time.

After plugging the thing in and throwing my ps3 controllers into it, I was very impressed!  It is so easy to use and does not use USB ports or power from the ps3 itself.  This is a bonus since it allows me to organize my equipment better.

The charger is styleish.  It is very shiny (which I really like shiny things :)).  One reviewer mentioned the lights are very bright.  this is true, but not a negative thing.  I like this feature because you do not have to get up close to see if the controllers are charged or not.  You can tell from anywhere in the room.  My solution to the bright lights when I don't play frequently is to plug the charger into a switched outlet.  Once they are charged and before I go to bed, I flip the switch in my living room and the charger turns off.  You could just take the controllers out as well.

The only drawback to the charger is that you have to remove the mini-keyboard accessory from the ps3 controller and plug in the special adapter to charge.  Not a huge deal, but can be inconvenient at times.

The E.A. hate train has started again, and it's unwarranted. I've been playing Madden since it was introduced on the Sega Genesis in 1989. Mind you, I've been disappointed with Madden this gen with the exception of Madden 10 which was actually very good. 11 and 12 were actually worse. But now we got Madden 13. It feels and plays great! the new animations and physics engine is pretty tight. It has some weird moments at times, but 90% of the time, it feels very smooth and convincing. Canned animations are definitely a thing of the past. Graphics are amazing. Great life on the sidelines, great weather effects and field degradition and excellent presentation. They actually did away with ESPN, taking a big risk, they went with the guys from CBS. Sims and Nantz are at the helm and do a pretty good job. A few hitches here and there, but we got a very decent presentation. While not endorsed by CBS, it still feels like CBS is doing the presentation stuff. I love the game speed also. I actually prefer to play at a ""very slow"" game speed and it feels like a real game. The passing feels very organic and sticking in the pocket is key. Throwing on the run again is very risky this year and you can't make the cheese plays like you used to. Online seems veyr stable. I actually played 3 games my first night on launch day and amazingly they booted right up and I had zero lag. People complain so much about online but E.A.'s servers are actually very good compared to the 2K servers which I continue to struggle with on their NBA franchise. As for people not saying Franchise is on the game. Guess again, it's just embedded through Connected Careers and there is tons to do. Go to Connected Careers, choose ""Coach"" mode, and start your franchise.  It's just a different approach. Lordy haters. You can also play as a Legend from the Past like Barry Sanders or Reggie White. Great stuff. So now...I have to say... First play the game before making a review.

Make no mistake. Madden 13 is not a perfect football game, but it's more than likely the best Madden ever made. They listened to the fans and they got a new engine and new physics engine. It's got some issues here and there, but overall you will love it. I highly recommend it for any self righteous Madden fan.

For a good solid review from an unbiased sports game site, Operation Sports has a very honest and straight up review on the game. 8.5 out of 10. I'm agreeing totally, best Madden ever made. Enjoy it for what it is, a great playing football game. If something is missing from last year that annoys you, then that's fine. But for me, I'm all for fixing the engine and making a new game before adding goodies.

I say this as someone who is not typically interested in multiplayer shooters, but who used to enjoy team shooters. It kind of makes sense that I like Overwatch because it feels like the ultimate class-based team shooter.

Let me list the things I love about Overwatch: It has fun and varied and attractive characters, multiple different game modes, gorgeous and well-designed zones, brilliant and rewarding post-game stats displays, built-in highlights, non-offensive microtransactions solely for cosmetic items, and so on.

Overwatch is a master class in videogame design. Here are some examples:

Enemy characters have louder footsteps, and their footsteps are distinctivethe samurai Hanzo is light on his fight while D.Va in her walking mech sounds like shes clomping around in a robotic exoskeleton.

Character silhouettes are so distinct that you can identify which character is around the corner based on the shadow it is throwing on a wall down the hall.

The post-game screens are brilliant and feel rewarding regardless of your personal skill level. It is much more than just a leaderboard, recognizing you for performing well with stats that make sense for the particular character(s) you used that game.

A few technical problems on console do arise, and there are some imbalanced characters on particular maps and modes, but I have faith that Blizzard will fix these issues over time because they have legendary support of their games.

I was like, I love 2D games, I love Mario and Sonic.  Shadow Complex was a great Next-Gen 2D game.  But what game could possibly be worth all that praise for a 2D game in 2009/2010.  Well I downloaded the demo...I was sold in about 2 minutes.  Immediately it becomes clear why the game is so much fun.  It isn't a game that takes ideas, this game truly is innovation.  The game not only allows you to customize sack boy but also customize just about anything in some way.  All sorts of hidden things to be found.  There is always about 3-4 panes of the 2D gameplay.  I have never played a 2D game with so many areas one can explore.  I've played two pane 2D games on Neo Geo games such as Top Hunter.  But this is something else.  The funny thing is, from pictures, you may think the graphics are nothing special.  But actually hands-on playing it.  Graphically, there is really no 2D game quite like it.  Its one of a kind.  The gameplay is always fun, sometimes puzzling.  You can go at things easy, or you can challenge youself to find all the hidden items.  Since the hidden items can actually be used for customization or creation.  It makes wanting to find these hidden items much more important then in most other 2D games with hidden objects.  The game of the year edition includes several fan made levels and some dlc extras such as the metal gear solid snake pack.  Cool little extras, but the game is great as is.  My only issue with the game, is the controls can be a little hit or miss.  Because the 2D levels have so many panes.  Sometimes I find myself skipping into another pane unintentionally.  Also if your pushing an item, once it can no longer be pushed, the controls automatically move you up a pane.  That actually be a bit annoying because I can't tell if I did it by accident or if the game did it on purpose. I wish they just let me push the object and then stop.  I can move myself to the next pan if I want to.  But none of that is big enough to hurt the game.  Its marvelous.  Deserves all its praise.

It's a little weird at first, like it feels genuinely spooky like HL2 did and has many different types of enemies as well as friends/neutrals. One bad thing is that the directions/instructions are very minimal and not well done, without the online FAQs and walkthroughs it would be easy to get frustrated and just give up playing altogether. It almost feels like this came directly from it's Russian makers through a bad translation, the booklet and in-game help is what I am referring to here.

I personally also use the trainers available as I don't have unlimited time to sit and work my way up to get everything and believe me one could spend hundreds of hours trying to do all the side missions and trying to get all the items and weapons not to mention the main storyline. This game is truly a great achievement, it has elements of almost every type of game and has some of the best graphics I've ever seen, on par and maybe better than HL2. It takes a lot of space understandably, 10 GB, and can tax my mid-range system at times with it's environments with some lag. Another thing is that you spend a lot of time just getting around, vehicles would have been really nice, maybe they are in there I estimate I'm about 25% done with the main storyline.

In short for the price it is definitely worth it and should not be missed, this one feels like the next generation every one has been talking about for a while now, ironically it's not one of those silly overpriced consoles!!",Amazing Game!,1179100800,5,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

Now! That being said, I really do love this figure- it's the most detailed Amiibo I've gotten my hands on so far (right along side Samus), and it's the closest I've gotten to having any ""official"" Xenoblade merchandise. The figure itself is well crafted for Amiibo, very solid, and it looks good just about anywhere you feel like displaying it. The only issue I had with the figure portion was that the Monado (his sword) was slightly bent upon arrival (not uncommon among these figures), but with a bit of patience I've been able to bend it into a proper shape. It's a non-issue and easily fixed, so I wouldn't even consider it a problem.

For the NFC portion- right now its uses are fairly limited, given that so few games are compatible with Amiibo. First, we'll talk about Smash Bros. Within that particular game, these are quite fun- it's essentially an NPC you can bring with you into Smash matches. You can change the costume, level it up through fights, and feed it items to boost its base stats. It learns and adapts to fight beside (or against) you, and it does this very, very well. However, you cannot ""play as"" your amiibo or use it in non-smash modes, likely since it would greatly unbalance the single player experience. While disappointing, it's understandable as this is supposed to be a game based on skill, not ""how many items do I have to eat until I'm unbeatable?"" This figure will also be compatible with the upcoming title Xenoblade 3DS, allowing you to unlock 3D models and music from the game itself.

It may be difficult to get your hands on this figure, but if you get the chance I suggest you take it! It's the best of the line I've seen so far, and it's a prime example of just how great Amiibo can be!",I'm really feeling it!,1423526400,44,,

But I decided to try it out mainly because of the reasonable sale price and that it is USB re-chargeable. I do not want to be throwing away battery money. And I figured if I can't get it to work with FireTV I could use it with other devices I have.

I am glad to say that I did get it to pair with my FireTV (Fire OS 5.0.5)! It wasn't the easiest to connect initially. I figured out that I had to 1) on fireTV choose Bluetooth device as the pairing option under Settings and then 2) make sure to use put the controller itself into the ""keyboard input"" pairing mode. That is holding the Mode button + A button. I had to try two or three times before fireTV picked it up.

I don't know if this mattered but I did make sure my controller was charged before trying to connect. Because I had experienced pairing issues like that with other bluetooth device.

Once it's paired and connected, the controller stays connected with active use. Temporary disuse doesn't affect the connection. It was only after I left it for maybe 10+ minutes that it disconnected itself. Like with other Bluethooth devices I have paired with the FireTV, re-connecting is sometimes glitchy. Most of the times, I can just hold the Mode + A button and FireTV would connect it immediately. A few times I had to navigate to the Settings menu and connect or find the device again. But this isn't limited to using this controller. So I'm not faulting it for this. In any case, this doesn't happen often enough to bother me.

The controller is quite easy to use and feels nice to hold. It does the job for me as I'm not playing any complex FPS or RPG games with it.

I also tried pairing and using it with my Mac (OS X) and iphone 6. Both paired quickly and worked just fine with the games supporting the controller.",Slight problem pairing with FireTV initially but works fine once connected,1462060800,123,,

434798,5.0,True,"10 10, 2016",A3BZ06T8L9LV8C,B01CKGI4RM,XZero,"The follow-up to the divisive Paper Mario Sticker Star is here, and defying all expectations, Paper Mario Color Splash is a must-own for Wii U owners. Its wit and charm are second to none, and it has some great mechanics. While it has certainly deviated from its origins on the Nintendo 64 and the GameCube, this game really stands on its own.

The story is pretty basic. Prism Island is an island in the Mario universe whose color is being sucked away (in some cases, literally being sucked away by Shy Guys with straws). The culprits are Bowser and the 7 Koopalings, and it's up to Paper Mario and the sentient paint can Huey to save Prism Island.

However, it is not the overarching story that serves as the main draw in this game. Rather, it's the brilliant little moments throughout the more narrow story beats. For example, at one point relatively early in the game, there is a particularly brave-sounding Toad who intends to set sail on an adventure to the ends of the world. Shortly thereafter, you find that he has become shipwrecked pretty close to the harbor from which he set off on his quest. A group of other Toads are standing on the pier making fun of him. Mario saves him by placing a gigantic fan behind him to blow him back to solid ground, and the gigantic fan rises up from the ocean in appropriately epic fashion. There is another moment where a Toad is hosting a game show on a beach, but it turns out he is scamming people because he cheats, and when Mario and Huey call him out on it, he gives up... but insists they cannot tell anyone. These are two simple examples of the sorts of humorous moments throughout the game.

One of Paper Mario's greatest successes, then, is its localization. People craving a localized release of Mother 3 should really turn their attention to this title. Nintendo's Treehouse localization team did an incredible job with the writing. There are a lot of games that attempt to be funny, from big-budget titles like Borderlands to a host of indie games. However, very few companies can nail the tongue-in-cheek tone of the humor in some of Nintendo's titles, and I would hold up Paper Mario Color Splash as a perfect example of localization done right.

The gameplay in Paper Mario is different from prior titles in the series. Paper Mario and Paper Mario: Thousand Year Door, on the N64 and GameCube, respectively, were more traditional RPGs. Super Paper Mario became much more of an action game, and Paper Mario Sticker Star introduced something resembling a card battle system. Color Splash uses a straight-up card battle system, but it does it very effectively. People who suggest this game is Sticker Star 2 in an effort to insult it are mistaken; this game is very much an improvement over the formula in the often-derided Sticker Star. In combat, you can select a card. Some cards are painted, others are not. Cards consist of allies (Koopa Troopas, Shy Guys, etc. who will fight for you until defeated or until the battle ends), attacks, items, and special moves. If you elect to paint an unpainted card, it will amplify that card's move's power.

***Pro Tip: Hidden in the options menu is an option to change the mechanics to permit both buttons and touch controls. Choose that option so instead of having to touch the Wii U GamePad's touch screen during every. single. battle., you can just press the A button and push up on the D-pad or the stick. It makes battles a lot quicker.***

One criticism is that bosses are more puzzle-based than they test your skills. There are items in the world that you can make into cards. These items will one-shot bosses, so the test is more in finding them and knowing to use the items than in displaying a degree of combat prowess. It is also noteworthy that there is not an experience system in this game. You ""level up"" by increasing your HP and paint capacity and by finding stronger cards. The emphasis in this game is much more on the environmental puzzles and exploration. Combat is just another puzzle to be solved in many cases, but beating enemies in combat is helpful for purposes of increasing your paint capacity and HP. Because enemies are on the world map, most combat encounters can theoretically be avoided, but battles are generally quick and painless.

Speaking of painless, the game is pretty easy. Some of the puzzles are really good and well-designed, but a player with any fundamental understanding of basic RPG gameplay is unlikely to struggle at all. My counter to the difficulty issue is that it the game succeeds on its merits with its smart writing and fun gameplay.

The world map is pretty big, but this most certainly is not an open-world RPG. Actually, this game is best described as the Paper Mario version of Super Mario 3D world in a lot of ways. Each area is called a ""course,"" and your goal is to collect a star from the course. Upon doing to, you have completed the course and will be sent out to the map. There will usually be more than one star in each course, so you will have to return and go for the other star(s) you missed the first time. In that sense, this game is very reminiscent of recent 3D Mario series outings. To advance the overall plot, you generally have to collect stars and put certain events into motion, often by interacting with and assisting NPCs. Additionally, the paint mechanics play a huge role, as one might expect. All throughout the world, there are spots that require repainting, so you can hit them with your hammer and Mario will paint them. Certain flowers and other foliage will release paint when struck by the hammer, and that will refill your paint supply. Completionists will love the fact that there is a percentage counter for each course that shows how much of the course has been repainted, so players can go back into the courses and find the elusive spots that need repainting. It's an entirely optional activity, but one which adds to the overall package.

Finally, Paper Mario is a very aesthetically pleasing game. From a visual perspective, this is probably the high water mark for the series. The paper cutout characters all look perfect, and there is a lot of subtle lighting which makes the characters look even more like physical pieces of paper. The graphics are very bright and colorful, and the game is a very cheerful, pleasant game to behold. Likewise, the music is excellent. Like other recent Nintendo first party games, the soundtrack is also mostly live music, which makes a difference. There are the expected arrangements of certain Mario series mainstays, but the original music is also highly enjoyable and always fitting.

Those who were hoping for Color Splash to return the Paper Mario series to its RPG-centric roots will, frankly, be disappointed. However, I would recommend not dismissing this game for increasingly distancing itself from its beginnings. Paper Mario's history has shown a willingness to depart from established formulas. The series began as ""Super Mario RPG 2"" on the Nintendo 64, but its development and the introduction of the paper aesthetics and gameplay gave it a very unique identity. Color Splash is a game that encourages exploration of its environments and interaction with its characters. I started this review praising the localization, and I want to end on that note. This is one of the best-written, funniest games available today. If its subtle, sarcastic, and ironic sense of humor is appealing to you, there is a lot to love for this game. Wii U owners are all too familiar with the overall lack of games on the console. I'm pleased to say that if this is one of the final first party Wii U games, at least it is ending the console's life on a high note. Color Splash is different from Paper Mario 64 and Thousand Year Door, but different does not always necessarily mean that it is inferior. Color Splash is a great game in general.

I have used every type of cooler imaginable and this is, by far, the best one I have ever used.  The Xbox one gets hot.  When placed in an entertainment shelving unit, top and rear exhaust fans tend to be rendered useless.  This thing pushes air in the right direction and will work with nearly any shelving configuration (except closed cabinet but what does?).  The biggest issue I have had with fans since the PS3/XB360 generation is the ""always on"" usb power.  Basically the fan would have a switch on it, independently of the console to allow you to turn it off and on.  Nothing like having remote controls for your TV, Surround sound, and Gamepads but having to get up and manually hit a button to the turn the fan off and on. This thing has a temperature sensor, built in, that turns the fan off and on automatically as the system warms up. This works well for two reasons:
1.) You don't have to turn if off and on and the always on power has no bearing on the cooler
2.) When you first power the system off, it still tends to be hot.  This will stay on to cool the device down even after it's been powered down.

This thing is also nearly silent compared to other coolers I have used.  It can get up there when the system is running at his hottest but it's barely noticeable compared to others on the market.

Back on my N64 and Playstation, I was always looking for Blitz, Madden, NCAA...you name it, I'd try it out. But for a while, sports were out of my mind. But now that I'm actually playing football for my H.S. squad, why not try some new games? Well, I made the right choice here.

Pros:

-All the teams are present from all across the country.

-The announcer voice is actually quite nice, but you can turn it off and just hear the P.A. do the play by play.

-Create-A-School returns! Create your own school down to the field design.

-There is actually a quest mode (so to speak). The ""Race For The Heismann"" allows you to make your way through four full college seasons and get drafted to the pros. You choose your name, number, position, appearance, and everything else.

Cons:

-There are no real player rosters, but given that the players only have 4 years to be on their teams, it's not a great surprise.

-Honestly speaking, the PS2 version's graphics aren't too hot, especially when compared to the XBOX version. The movement is kind of jerky, and the players look choppy.

-The commentary gets kind of repetitive on occasion.

-The field grunts and tackle crunching sounds aren't too realistic.

This game is a nice choice for hardcore college football fans. Can't say I am one, but I've rediscovered the sport of football, and I can't help but recommend this game.",Perhaps the best college football game I have played in a while,1130630400,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

At every level there is a number of colored pegs that have to be hit in order to clear the level. They are amongst generic pegs that is OK to hit yet will hinder your access to the colored ones you have to clear - and you have only a limited number of shooting balls.
Every time you shoot a ball it gets used - unless you are lucky to fall into an oscillating bucket and gets recycled. There are also special pegs that give you special abilities for a limited time.
I am afraid I am not doing justice to the game - if it sounds complicated it is not. You pick it up in a minute and it is GREAT FUN!

You are given a task, but you can execute anyway you can think.
Do you want to blast your way in? Or snipe from far away?
Heck, you could just steal a helicopter and just drop in from the sky.
The only limitations were your imagination.

This is the first game that I have played since then that gives you that same freedom.

For example, you have to stop a convoy of supply trucks in this game.
* You can bring a bridge down on top of them.
* You can block the road with other trucks and blow them up as the convoy approaches.
* You can approach from behind and run them off the road in a truck of your own.
* Heck, just stand in the middle of the road with a rocket launcher and pluck each one off.

For me, I love a game that makes you pause just to think of the most creative
destructive possible way to execute a mission. You become proud of your strategy.

The graphics are good enough.
The Geo-Mod technology that lets you blow up everything is awesome.
The targeting system could use some work, but it doesn't hurt the game,
just makes it more challenging.

Truly remarkable creation and a rich mix of ideas which amount to an engaging and fantastic adventure. The world is large, grand and beautifully rendered.

Just to say, if u like RPGs, this one is a no brainer. Easily a 5 star. I have played many RPGs from Final Fantasy 7, 8, 9, 12, Legend of Zelda (a whole bunch of them), just to name a few. This one is right up there with the best I ever played. Elements of other games, but unique in it's own right.

Quick Pros:
-beautiful and breathtaking
-character creation, basic, but enough to make your character your own
-loads of weapons, armor, magic, and abilities to level up.
-craft some of the things you will use
-free roaming environment
-engaging main story, many side missions

I found a well rounded game with no real cons, but I have some recommendations for the next installment in the series if there is one
-extended character creation options
-more varied boss type battles (many of the bosses fight with similar styles)
-some online interactivity (even a common area for players to communicate and trade crafted items)

215289,5.0,False,"12 23, 2010",A29RO1H44PGGC7,B003QOWQP4,dirt55,"I have a long history with Rhythm Games since they were first released years ago starting with Guitar Hero.  I have played GH 1-3, own GH World Tour and Aerosmith and Rockband 1 and 2 with all the common large plastic accessories.  In no was I looking for another Rhythm Game to add to my collection.  I felt that I had plenty of time and experience with these games that I was very likely done with the genre.  DJ Hero came and I resisted the urge to purchase.  DJ Hero 2 then came along and got rave reviews from both players and gaming journalists/critics.  I have a great love for video games AND hiphop, so when I walked past this game at a local store and saw it marked down, I just couldn't resist.  This is easily one of my favorite games... ever.

Graphics:
For a rhythm game you don't expect much.  Honestly you're not even looking at the background just the highway of notes coming down.  What I really did love is that the characters are at their peak in regards to style and variety that you would expect from activision, but above all of that you get to actually play with your avatar.  I am NOT a fan of avatars or Miis in general, but it is so fun to see your own avatar seamlessly incorporated into the game during online battles.  How fun!  ""You go boy!""

Music:
There shouldn't really be any surprises here since they have the track list available both online and on the back of the box.  The mixes are great and don't suffer from ""over-mixing"" where by the end of the track you're tired of hearing so many scratches, rewinds, or random air horns or ""yeah yeahs"" that you never want to hear the song again.  This does not happen.  I was constantly entertained and surprised at how I enjoyed some of the mixes with really random songs (Informer/ABC, Love Lockdown/Bad Girls) even more then songs with some of my favorite artists.

Gameplay:
Phenomenal.  I can't express how much I enjoy this game.  It completely mixes up what I was use to in the Rhythm Game genre.  No more of just hitting colored buttons as they come down the highway.  Yes you do hit up to three buttons, but you also cross fade and tune the track with effects.  I was shocked at how well built and solid the turntable felt compared to all my previous GH/RB accessories (including the drum kits).  One thing that you should know is that this game does not really come across as a big multiplayer game.  There are online battles, plus you can play with another turntable and a mic, but it really feels like it's more of a solid single player experience.  I actually appreciated this more due to the fact that with my other games if I couldn't find another person to play with, then I usually wouldn't play.  There is also a great feature that you can just have this game auto play the songs if you wanted to listen to your favorite tracks as you do other things in the house or if you were having a party this would be a great substitute for creating your own mix for entertainment.

As you can tell I love this game and I had huge reservations about getting it.

Anyway, this is it. The first ""Tomb Raider"" game. It has classic written all over it. Despite being dated, and encountering countless predecessors, sequels and dissapointing movies the game manages to have to a strong following and is considered to best game of them all.
It was orginal back then, where archaeologist Lara Croft, a female Indiana Jones, is called upon to use her intelligence, amazing physical skills, and her big guns to solve complexed and ancient puzzles, battle hard enemies and travel the whole world in style. I forget the storyline, since I haven't played this game in ages, but it's good. You should ask my mom, who played and beat every ""Tomb Raider"" game(Sorry mom). I'm not kidding! She did! The graphics are surprisingly good to look at, as well as the hard puzzles to solve(which made it famous to play) and the fun movie scenes. Check out the dinosaur too in this game. it's a blast!

5444,5.0,False,"01 21, 2004",A36RRLVEBABY5Z,B00001XDUB,Axel Law,"While ""Resident Evil"" was widely popular as a survival horror series, Konami decided to take advantage of this genre and along came ""Silent Hill.""  You played the role of Harry Mason, who was going to take a vacation in the remote town of Silent Hill with his adopted daughter Cheryl, whom he found on the side of the road and no one had knowledge of her.  Once entering the town, he loses Cheryl and yearns to find her... only to find the town is covered in fog and strange things are afoot.  An extremely enthralling and creepy game... read on if you dare:
THE GOOD
The storyline has more plot twists than a pretzel.  You'll get lost in it several times and some of it doesn't really make sense... but it keeps you hooked.  Hooked as if your sensitive areas were going to explode if you stopped playing.  This game is dated by today because of the second and third Silent Hill's, but I still find this game to be creepy today.  To tell you the truth, while I hate comparing games, I do find this game to be scarier than ""Resident Evil.""  While both game series are fun, this one has that series beaten in the ""creepy"" department; evil nurses and demon children will attack you when you least expect it, even with your radio blaring out static.  In fact, you'll hear crazy sounds while you're playing it, and you'll be scared EVEN when your radio is not on (which by the way, the radio tells you if enemies are nearby.  If it's not blaring out static, no monsters are near you).  The environments, especially in the nightmare world LIKE THE FRIKKEN HOSPITAL, are downright scary and provide an atmosphere that's incredibly attacking your senses.  There are three endings and one alternate ""funny"" ending involving aliens, which makes the game more interesting.  The game is reasonably hard with its downright mindboggling puzzles and religious symbolism, but with a strategy guide (or a friend who knows what he/she is doing), this game actually isn't all that difficult.  What MAKES it difficult is whether or not you can sit through this terrifying game all the way through it.  ;)
My favorite scary bit... funny in a freaky way: When you're in the school, you find a locker with something inside budging it.  You open it and a cat runs out.  The cat runs out the door and you hear a crunch sound as if it was eaten.  When you enter the NIGHTMARE school, you find that same locker, only with NOTHING in it except a pool of blood.  Konami was on drugs when they made this game.
THE BAD
Nothing bad I can think of.  I was going to order you to consult your physician before playing this game like I normally do... but then again, you might consult a psychiatrist once you start playing because it's just THAT creepy.
OVERALL
If you want a game that'll scare the piss out of you, this is the game for you.  With scary environments and monsters, creepy characters, and a storyline that will mess with your brain to no avail, this game hooks your attention like no other game can.  You'll want to beat this game and then breathe a sigh of relief once it's over... then you got two more games which are ten times scarier than this one!  A must-have for Playstation fans.  In fact, one of the reasons to own a Playstation, period.",Fine Survival Horror,1074643200,3,,

Pros: 1. The graphics are superb and they give the best detail ive ever seen...

2. You get to drive a boat, get a gravity gun which is awesome, and battle very cool looking creatures.

3. Very cool weapons and guns to put down you foes..

4. The character is very likable, hes like a duke nukem of the sci fi games.

Cons: 1. Unfortanately, you need a very good computer to play it and a good graphics cards as well. My game lagged the whole time i played making it very slow and choppy and froze alot. So, i didn't get the real experience of playing.

2. You have to install 5 cds and it takes quite a while to do it. Plus, you have to install Steam which takes a while to install right. So, the waiting time sucks and steam and the game together take up half your computer's space. (people with lots of space and room don't worry about the space problem.)

I use the reviews on amazon to help me decide when to purchase, it helps hearing from people who have the specific item I'm looking at.  Anyway, I got this mouse for videogames on my PC and I've not been disappointed yet.  The colors change on the mouse which isn't a huge deal when I'm playing but it's pretty cool when I'm not on my computer.  It's dark enough that it won't annoy me when I'm watching a movie in the room.  It's got a pretty standard button configuration and is really customizable via the razer control panel.  The info is stored on a cloud server so I can use my mouse on other pc's and not have to worry about setting it up again every time.  It's not a make-or-break it sort of feature but I have found it useful.  I have had a gaming mouse that was wireless, g10 or something, but I hated running out of batteries in-game (which seemed to happen too often).  This model has a cable, but its long enough to use from the couch behind me (as I have my video card HDMI slot tied to my TV).

However, it draws on tons of Lord of the Rings references, so if you have not read a book, seen the movies, or played another game; this may seem slightly nerdy to you.
The game has so many aspects, that it is difficult to describe them all. You could abandon following the main storyline and still be able to play for many hours. One of the main side missions is killing Orc captains. Even though it is only a side mission, they are also incorporated in the main missions. Shadow of Mordor also has many unique ways it presents battle. You are able to drain energy out of enemies, which you use to power up your bow, which has ghost like power. You can also grab enemies and are given three options: draining the enemy, shanking them, or interrogation. Interrogation gives you intel about Orc captains. In order to grab a captain, you have to wear them down in battle first, and they give you intel about Orc War chiefs.  Side missions are similar to Assassin's Creed. They follow rescuing slaves, completing a certain number of stealth kills, or things in that area.
Main storyline follows various tasks that connect back to the main book and movie series, with characters like Gollum and references to Wraiths.

I will, however, review the special edition packaging and game add-ons. First, this edition comes with everything that is included with the standard edition of the game (game disc, large full-color fold-out map of the world). In addition, you get a classy looking steelbook case for the game, a second fold-out map (this one a blueprint with additional points of interest) and a code for redeeming additional stunt plane trials, free guns and add-ons in the Ammu-nation stores and power-ups for your characters. The free guns are great because you are short on cash in the early stages and the power-ups mean your characters regenerate their special abilities 25% faster than those used by standard edition owners.

What I never heard of was this game causing the Red Ring of Death. Before I could even play a single inning, the game kept freezing up at the intro of a game until I finally got the RROD. Now if THAT happened to everybody, I could understand the bad reviews. But as far as I know mine was an isolated incident and it just so happened it was my time to get the RROD.

But now that my system is fixed and I've gotten a chance to play this game, I can't recall having this much fun since playing NBA 2K11. I picked this title over 2K10 and 2K11 because I did not like the pitching system in those games. This one is so much easier and uncomplicated. And the graphics are UNBELIEVABLE! I haven't had any problems figuring out the controls and they seem fine to me. There might be some bugs here and there, but it's nothing major. The 2K baseball games have never been perfect, and I've been playing them since the Dreamcast days.

The design works better with white than black in my opinion.  It's really white.  Not an off-white.  I didn't realize how white the controller was until I compared it to the Titanfall controller which was also white.  It makes the Titanfall controller white look more like a putty white.  The console comes with Sunset Overdrive, an amazing game that's probably up for game of the year since it's reviewing so well.  It comes as a downloadable code, not a disc.

There is no Kinect so you might want to pick that up.  Totally worth it.  You can find it used on Ebay for much cheaper than a new one.

For those that haven't checked up on the changes for the console, it's all improved for the better.  Friends and party chat support is improved.  The BluRay playback is still great.  The TV snap is bigger now so it's easier to watch football or TV shows while playing a game.  The chat audio is so crystal clear that you can hear your friends fidget in their leather chairs.  You can play back your MKV or any time of files via a USB drive.  They update the operating system monthly (sometimes faster than that!) so we're constantly getting new features.

You can hook up external hard drives (HDDs) and put your games on them.  My external 3TB HDD is actually faster than the internal HDD on the One!  You can also move this external HDD between Xbox One systems to play your games (which I'm doing until I pick up another HDD for this white console).  So if you wanted to go to your friend's house and play, you can just bring the hard drive (and disc if you bought a disc game).

You really can't go wrong with the system.  Games look and play great.  Chat audio is great.  It's so much faster than the 360 in turning on because the One can be in sleep mode and wake up almost instantly.  You can be at work, buy a game, and the One will automatically download it so it's ready when you get home.  You can play a game while downloading (something that really couldn't happen on he 360)!

All the bundles are on huge sales right now!  Now only do you get $50 off, but it comes with a game so it's really under $300 for a console.",Loving the white!!!,1414886400,6,,

For example, with Luxor, the shooter is at the bottom of the screen and your goal is to eliminate all of the balls.

In Zuma Deluxe, the goal is the same except that the frog shooter is at the *center* of the board and rotates 360 degrees. Chains of various colored balls snake towards an opening. If the balls reach that opening, you lose a life. (You get 3 lives per game, but can accrue additional lives if you score 30,000 + points  if I recall).

There are quite a few puzzles within each Level; however, you have to complete ALL the stages in order to reach the next Level. For example, I'm on Level 6 which happens to have 6 Stages. I can't get past this tricky Stage 6, so I keep getting knocked back down to Stage 1 of Level 6.

Random balls will light up during gameplay and if you eliminate the chain that contains these particular balls, you get special temporary perks. For example, there are balls that will create a laser shot for accuracy, slow down the balls, stop the balls, reverse the balls, or fry all the surrounding balls (this one is my fave!).

Also, there is a coin that shows up randomly on the outskirts of the maze and if you hit the coin, you get extra points. You also get extra points for shooting chains in the middle of ""gaps"".

There are triangular mazes, circuituous square mazes, and even mazes with two openings. Perhaps the most tricky, however, are those that snake under one another, making it difficult to track the balls.

You can play two versions: Gauntlet and Adventure. You can choose to make the game full screen or small screen.

My only complaint is that I bought this game in the store and like Bookworm (another Pop Cap game), I had to re-download a game using a universal .exe patch in order to get the game to work. Without it, the game starts with a 60 minute ""trial period"" that won't allow you to play beyond it. This is a serious glitch that Pop Cap Games needs to deal with, because it affects other games, too (such as Insaniquarium). If you need the patch, un-install Zuma Deluxe and re-install using [...]

I could never get into the dual analog controls of previous FPS games (including the original Metroid Prime games).  I was impatient with steering via joystick, hated the imprecise aiming, and thus, I felt FPS games were inaccessible and laborious.

Enter Nintendo who realizes the barrier between games and gamers like me.  Once you pick up the controller and look around in Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, all feels natural.  Retro Studios really nailed the controls for this game.  This is the first game in a long where I could not wait to get back to playing.  And when I did, I would play for at least 3 hours at a time late into the night.

You must play this game in widescreen 480p; it is beautiful!  I played this game right after Resident Evil 4, which I thought looked pretty good.  After I beat Metroid, I went back to RE4 and the difference is jolting.  Metroid looks amazing and runs incredibly smooth.

The boss battles are pretty epic and are just about the right amount of difficulty for a FPS novice like me.  Of course you can ramp up the difficulty level if you're a pro.  The puzzles require some thinking, but are never too tough.  Backtracking is not too bad a chore; it's easy to find where you need to go and you don't have to journey too far out of the way.

Some gripes:  There are many mini-boss battles that become repetitive.  The game is pretty short (I think I took my time appreciating the game and it took me 20 hours).  Sometimes in the heat of an intense battle, I had trouble executing the grapple beam (which requires a thrust of the nunchuk controller).

In conclusion, this game is a must buy for Wii owners.  Even if you think you don't like FPS's, this game is worth a shot.  It is so much fun, you'll forget you're playing a game and believe that you're part of it.",Addictive with Dead-on Controls,1190764800,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It is an open world game ( sort of like Grand Theft Auto ), but it has some of the moral choices like Fallout, so you can play as either good or evil.  The only knock is there is no benefit in being neutral since the best powers are at the extremes of good evil.  The story is somewhat linear, but there are a lot of side missions and items to collect.

The electrical based powers work very well within the world.  Hitting a car too many times with electricity will cause it to explode ( possibly killing civilians ).  The ability to grind on the power lines and rails is a lot of fun and helps you move about the city quickly.

The story is interesting, but doesn't get in the way of playing the game.  They are missing a button to skip the cutscenes ( Assassin's Creed should get blamed for this ).

I have played both good and evil.  I don't know how much replay beyond that the game really has, but it was about 20 hours for each.  I figure that an enjoyable game at [...] an hour is a fair deal.  It is not the value that Fallout 3 is, but the pacing is much better.

I really got into it and ended up earning the Platinum trophy. The game is composed of many modes so I will be reviewing this game in parts.

Story: The game describes the story in ""Tales"" Each ""Tale"" tells a different part of the anime from a different characters point of view. You begin with an anime cutscene. Next you will go through a series of fights followed by a picture book style narration that sums up the anime between fights. Each enemy is more difficult then the next. After the final fight you are greeted with a final anime scene. This pattern is applied for many of the tales. There are 11 different tales. Three tales are unlocked from the beginning and after completion new tales unlock. The first three tales available are The Tale of Naruto Uzumaki, The Tale of Sasuke Uchiha, and the Tale of Young Naruto Uzumaki.

Gameplay: The Graphics and Gameplay are very similar to the Dragonball games. So, if a gamer has played those games he should have no problem playing it the first time. The character you select has access to several varying attacks. Attacks can consist from punches and kicks to ninja shurikens to Ninjutsu. Ninjutsu are the special attacks in this game similar to Goku's Kamehameha or Ryu's Hadouken. Ninjutsu requires chakra or energy similar to Ki in the Dragonball games. If enough is gathered you can perform a special attack with more damage.

Free Battle: Players can fight the CPU or a second player in versus using characters unlocked.  There is also a survival mode where you fight characters however your health does not reset after every fight. Instead a certain amount is replenished based off your performance and if you followed objectives. There is also a tournament mode in which you enter a tournament of many characters. You fight a few rounds working your way up the tournament bracket and eventually winning the finals.

For anyone new to the Naruto series this is a good game to start with. It covers the initial series as well as the beginning of Shippuden. With a decent sized character roster one can reenact many fights that occurred within the series. As my first Naruto game I was very pleased.",A review from a gamer who platinum trophied the game,1403740800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I feel as though I should offer something of an explanation as to my decision to wax philosophical on a title that is as old, honored, and tested as Earthbound.  Granted, retro-reviews are indeed all the rage, but I cannot say that I have been moved to ever actually commit to a write-up on one before.  There are certainly other games that, as an experience, are by far more readily cited as an example of technical or artistic merit.

That's the issue, though: Earthbound is not so much a technical achievement or artistic triumph as it is an experience, a part of one man's life story told in a surreal third person.  Shigesato Itoi, Earthbound's creator, undertook a profoundly personal journey, choosing to tell the tale of childhood utilizing his most familiar medium - game design.  The result was a journey so profound that those with even the most tenuous grasp of childhood emotions, sensations and innocent awe could not help but walk away without feeling its effects.

For a game with the original title of Mother 2, perhaps this childish world view is simply par for the course.  In Earthbound, the world is on the brink of ruin; Giygas, an alien entity, has grown strong thanks to the darkness of the world.  Its corruption, hatred, greed, violence and depravity eventually allow him to grow powerful and conquer the world.  A sentient bee named Buzz Buzz, a resistance fighter of a distant future, travels back in time (to our present) to find a young boy who was said to have the power to defeat Giygas before the alien's strength becomes insurmountable.

That young boy is Ness, an average kid from Onett who lives with his mother, sister, and dog.  Ness's father, while constantly away on business, can be reached by phone, and provides pithy guidance to his son and maintains his savings account.  (The implications regarding absentee fathers are hardly understated in Earthbound, but seek to offer a comforting picture of positive maturity to children.  Fathers are important, the game tells us, but so much that their presence - or lack thereof - need not define your identity or sense of self-worth.)

You travel throughout the world, battling all manner of whimsical (and sometimes down-right terrifying) foes who have been corrupted by Giygas's all-pervading influence.  The player will meet friends who share their goal, and eventually they will overcome many obstacles and face off against Giygas him/itself.  However, even this ""final confrontation""  is hardly the over-wrought clich that one might assume.

In fact, the battle is one of video game-dom's most famous, and with good reason.  What makes the final battle with Giygas so amazing, so profound, is its summation of the childhood journey.  While we are given some details of Giygas in Mother, there is very little that we know about him, especially regarding his metamorphosis into the embodiment of evil, fear, and hatred.  What is Giygas?  Even in his mindless state of complete hatred, he seems lost, hurt...like a child calling out for his mother.

Perhaps if we look at Itoi's inspiration for the final confrontation with the End of All Things, we can gain an appreciation for his conception of innocence, and indeed, the gray that lies between the black and white absolutes of established morality.  This is no mere quest to topple the villain, but an examination of the journey itself, which is captured on numerous occasions by an itinerant photographer to remind you of your travels and experiences with friends.  At game's end, it feels almost like a scrapbook, and one cannot but help and reflect on their childhood adventures, as well.

Earthbound is a tremendous game, and an even greater examination of the creator's own worldview.  In that, it is impossible not to see something of ourselves in the game, of our own years of innocent wonder, those that led, inexorably, to maturation and knowledge.  To top it all off, it is also a solid RPG, though some might find its mechanics to be ""dated"" by modern standards.  Others will find comfort in its old-school charm, and use it as it was intended - as a vehicle through one of the greatest narratives not only in gaming, but modern media.",Gaming's Single-Greatest Narrative,1304899200,2,,

Those of you who are used to fast twitch games will enjoy flipping around like a killer gymast.

The Rayne character is ""fast"". The camera is twitchy and changes angles during fights, even when reduced to 10% sensitivity. Rayne also jumps likes a jaguar, which causes even more havoc with the camera.
By reducing the camera sensitivity, you help reduce the shifting camera angles, but you also nullify using the mouse to control Rayne's direction.
Again, those used to fast twitch games shouldn't have a problem ... I'm sure a gamepad would help(... I'm unable to use them)

Recommended cards are Nvidia 6800 and Radeon 9800 Pro or X800.
You do have 4 options before starting the game to turn on/off specific visual effects.

Nice feature is the built in cheat codes.
I didn't mind dying, more killing time for me.
But as the game progresses, it gets pretty tough. Even the normal enemies(... without their own health bar) become a handful.

Another plus is, you don't have to complete objectives immediately.
You can just keep killing to earn carnage or fatality points, as enemies will continuously respawn.

Yes, Rayne is hot, the weapons cool, combat moves quite spectacular and the powers fun.
I was surpised by the different locals in which you fight; nice diversity.
The story/plot was interesting.
If you read the dialogue, watch the screen and check your objectives, you have all the info to succeed ... surviving is another matter

It's basically a kill-fest ... how you do it is up to you

My only disappontment was the ""unlockable"" outfits.
It appreares as though you can unlock 4(?) outfits ... I was expecting one per each time you finish the game ... and I was expecting some ""hot"" outfits
I was wrong on both counts.
After you finish the game, 11 outfits are unlocked. None are ""hot"".
I believe 4 were different colors of the gown(... nothing new), you have a S&M outfit(... doesn't look like Rayne), a Cowgirl outfit = ?, a Schoolgirl outfit with really short skirt = ?, and a knight in armor = just what I want, Rayne all covered up. I might have missed one ?
I was hoping for: gowns cut differently up top ... dresses that ended at upper thigh(... I'm no fashion expert) ... short/tight shirt + shorts ... a bikini ... a wet t-shirt ... or body paint with the BloodRayne icon
Ok, I'm a guy, shoot me.
All they had to do was look at a fashion magazine or the SI Swimsuit Edition to come up with ideas.
Frankly, their choices stink. They had a good idea; unlock outfits. But it was poorly implemented and the choices, IMO, worse than the standard gown/outfit.
Considering the game is rated M and obviously for guys: the gore(... impalement, dismemberment, blood); nudity(...Ferrill); language ... you would think spicing up the oufits wouldn't be stretching the boundaries ?
It's a small disappoinment.

You know it's fun when you don't mind replaying segments.
Most fun I've had playing a game.
Even the quips by Rayne and the enemies had me laughing.
Those of you with good manual dexterity will have replay value due to the multiple combat moves; some are quite complex ... fun to watch(... I needed god mode in order to hold down the keys without being killed before finishing the move )

I got both consoles from two different sellers, and definitely not the one Amazon puts up in the search results. Recommend that you take a scroll through the list of other sellers; you're much more likely to get a better deal from there. Never spent more than $180 on either console.

289445,5.0,False,"06 20, 2013",A57Q87B0TC9IJ,B00BFOEY3Y,Derek G,"I first fell in love with Logitech products when I put my hands on their MX1000.  It was the only time I paid full retail price for a mouse.  As soon as I put my hand on it I knew I had to have it.  After that died, it was replaced by the stalwart MX Revolution which still works to this day (although their so-called ""unifying"" software won't support it.) *shakes fist*  The reason why I preface this is because many gamers have used a MX Revolution at some point and the G700s seems to be an evolution of the popular mouse.

Like the MX, the G700s has that molded to the hand feel.  If you're a palm gripper like me, it feels like the kind of mouse you can rest your entire hand on.  Supposedly, the material allows you to wick sweat away from your palms while gaming.  That doesn't happen to me so I can't test the validity.  The top of the mouse feels like smooth metal but the sides took a little getting used to.  It's a rough texture that frequently made me wonder if the mouse was dirty.  It takes a little getting used to.

The mouse wheel can be smooth scrolling or click scrolling as determined by the button directly behind the wheel.  This brings up a gripe about button placement.  You see the button selector sticks up high enough that it's difficult to reach the other button behind it.  You will likely never use it or use it for ""non-critical"" things.  Personally I have it mapped to check the battery level; a nice feature that lights up one to three arrows depending on the amount of juice left in your mouse.

Speaking of batteries, you're going to need a few spares.  It comes with a single AA Eneloop rechargeable battery.  I am grateful that Logitech isn't playing the ""irreplaceable battery"" game like other manufacturers.  At the same time, you will either need to be very diligent about attaching the USB cable after a session or you will need to have some spares as the battery lasts little more than a day of gaming.  For me, this isn't an issue because I've already jumped on the rechargeable battery bandwagon and I have a drawer full of spare eneloops.  If you don't have them, consider purchasing something like this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/eneloop-4-Pack-AA-Ni-MH-Pre-Charged-Rechargeable-Batteries-with-4-Position-Charger/dp/B004RP2VNI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">eneloop 4 Pack AA, Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries with 4 Position Charger</a>&nbsp;and it will save you a lot of headaches.

On to button placement.  The side of the mouse has four buttons that are easily distinguished by your thumb as the top two stick out slightly farther than the bottom two.  The three buttons on the top-left of the mouse I'm not as impressed with.  They are formed in a concave shaped that seems out of place on this otherwise ergonomic mouse.  The top and bottom buttons are not too difficult to reach without mistakes but the middle is oddly placed between the two.  Someone with a claw grip would have a better shot at distinguishing the three than someone with a palm grip.  The mouse wheel can also click left and right.  All buttons are customizable using the Logitech Gaming Software.

The Logitech Gaming Software is a fully featured customizer allowing five different profiles to be customized for gaming on the road.  For at-home gamers, the software can scan your hard drive for existing games and add your selections to a seemingly infinite number of allowable profiles.  Each profile is determined by the filename executed when the game starts.  If you are familiar with navigating your computer files and folders this should not be an issue but it may prove problematic for those unfamiliar with delving into gaming folders.  I have found gaming detection to be mostly good but the occasional game aggravation pops up.  For instance, when Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon was released, the software would not detect the game until I Alt-tabbed out of the game and back in again.  Buttons can be programmed to repeat while held down or toggled on and off.  One notable exception is mouse-clicks.  Try as I might, I couldn't find a way for mouse-clicks to be repeated as long as I held down the left or right mouse buttons.

If I had a wish list, I would ask the engineers to change two things.  First, I'd have them scrap the buttons in the upper left in favor of a design similar to their entry-level G300 mouse.  That mouse has two buttons on the top left and two buttons on the top-right.  Both sides are easily ""nudged"" without having to take your fingers off the left and right mouse buttons.  Secondly, I would want a charging base so the battery can be easily charged after a gaming session instead of plugging in cords and/or replacing the battery day after day.  Aside from these two requests, this is a dynamite solid mouse, well-engineered, with a lot of weight and decent button placement.",Solid ergonomic mouse with good software but you'll need batteries,1371686400,2,,

4643,5.0,False,"03 30, 2001",ABRKIJ6D4V42O,B00001LDCK,Amazon Customer,"I bought Homeworld when it was first released, in 1999. When I first played the game, my reaction was the same as that of many others who have posted their reviews - the interface was difficult to master, the missions were too difficult. Eventually, I gave up and put Homeworld back onto the shelf. It's now 2001, and Homeworld has built up a huge following on the internet. So I re-installed the game on my computer...and got a major surprise.
The first time round, I'd seen this games flaws. It DOES have a difficult to master interface. Its missions are VERY difficult to play - especially those set in the Garden of Kadesh nebula (missions 7 - 9). The big difference is that there are many sure-fire strategies posted on the internet that can assist you in getting past the more difficult missions.
Once you've gotten used to the interface, and the totally new mind-boggling environment of real 3D space, Homeworld is a surprisingly enjoyable game. The graphics are what draw you in first. Two years after it was first produced, and I find the graphics to be totally entrancing. I'm not sure whether even new games like Sacrifice or Giants: Citizen Kabuto can surpass it...at least not without upgrading your PC to a 1GHz CPU.
Like the Command & Conquer games, you have to harvest resources and build a massive army. But there are two big differences - the space fleet you build in one mission is carried over into the next mission. I enjoy this aspect of the game - there's a deep sense of satisfaction when you see the massive fleet of 10 ion-cannon frigates, 5 destroyers and 2 heavy cruisers you just built.
The second major difference is that you can capture other spaceships and add them to your fleet. Annoyed with those pesky multi ion-beam frigates attacking your mothership? Just send a squadron of salvage corvettes after them and capture the entire fleet! This is definitely one of the most important aspects of playing Homeworld - learning how to sneak a squad of salvage corvettes towards an enemy fleet.
The story isn't terribly original. What is original is the style in which it is presented. This is no slick, Hollywood-produced motion-picture like Tiberian Sun or Red Alert 2. The production style is much closer to a pared-back Japanese anime. To be honest, despite the comparisons to Star Wars or Star Trek, Homeworld is a much closer relation to Star Blazers, Robotech or Macross. Especially when you have spaceships like the Heavy Cruiser (a very close relation to Robotech's SDF-1), or the Destroyer (Star Blazers fans will LOVE the wave-motion gun effects from its ion-cannons!).
In conclusion, I strongly recommend Homeworld to strategy gamers with an open mind. When it was first released, very few people had the PC's with sufficient processing power to play this game. Now? If you have anything faster than a Pentium III 450MHz, then I can't recommend this game highly enough. It is a classic that you'll be hooked on and playing years from now. Just buy this game.

It really didn't have too much ""wash, rinse, repeat"" for me. I found the missions varied and challenging. There isn't much of a story here, and you are unlikely to bond much with any character. However, as zombie games go, there is at least some pretense of a mission.
The night time missions really made me anxious. I kind of kept most stuff to the daytime. I am a big chicken.
The weapon modifications were a lot of fun, though I found that my collections tended towards the same ingredients resulting in overused mods (Angel Sword). This does lead to some pretty awesome zombie bashing, with occasional slo-mo animations just for fun.
Pilfering materials does get old after a bit. When I started to get bored I added on ""The Following"" DLC, which opened up the world quite a bit.
Controls are OK. I had some troubles hitting my mark on jumps, moreso in The Following where you climb towers. Your jump follows your sight line, except when it doesn't.
All in all, I got my money out of this game. I played for several months and enjoyed it. I admit to playing only the single player version. I have trouble when someone else pops into my game.

17858,5.0,False,"10 11, 2000",AX8SWWB9837TA,B00004VP4B,Chris Peters,"Absolutely.  This is a high-powered, high budget technical thriller, with amazing visual and great acting.  Oh, and the thing plays like a dream, too.
MGS starts as you swim into an terrorist base in Alaska via submarine insertion.  The music and Hollywood-quality cutscenes will draw you in immediately.  You must use stealth and your intelligence to sneak your way into the heart of the base and prevent a nuclear war.  And the deeper you go, the stranger everything becomes...
The game plays beautifully.  You are usually in stealth mode, trying to figure a route past the guards and security systems.  If you are spotted, you don't die, but rather must fight your way to a safe, hidden spot, and after 30 seconds, the guards relax and you go back to stealth mode.  This dual-nature is the perfect compromise, punishing you just enough to push you in the right direction, but never at the expense of fun.  This also adds a puzzle-aspect to the game.  You must use your head, and thankfully, the plot always keeps you in that state of mind by never insulting your intelligence.  The encounters with the more powerful terrorists will change the game completely, and I certainly won't ruin the surprises, except one.  At one point, your partner is shot down in the open, and you must engage in a sniper duel to save her.  The screen shakes with the beat of your heart!
Overall, the story is exciting and very mature.  This is a big-budget action movie along the theme of Tom Clancy tech thrillers like ""Clear and Present Danger"".  Older adults will easily be interested.  The only (minor) complaint I have is that some of the dialog get long-winded.  You character will have a 10-minute conversation on his radio, flirting with some lab-technician, while the enemy is patroling only 10 feet away.
This PC version is a basic port of the playstation game - you don't get anything extra over the most recent (japanese)version.  That is still alot, though - the complete game, plus hundreds of VR stealth missions (which are a blast) and first-person mode available only in Japan.  The graphics are good, even for being a straight rehash of the 2-year-old playstation graphics.  This is the only true improvement provided with the PC version - you can increase the resolution from the terrible 320x200 Playstation resolution.  With FSAA on, the game looks great.  However, you will definitely notice the low-resolution textures, and the rather primative models.  The developers should have taken the time to at least deepen the major character models, and make Solid Snake's face not look so blurry.  An improvement over the PS version, but beneath what you expect from a PC game these days.
If you still haven't played this game, do.  The PC version is now definitely the way to go.",Does a Great Playstation Game Make a Great PC Game?,971222400,8,,

Story:4.5/5
They give you a brief overall what you need to know on the main website and then you play this story mode. Easy to understand and follow and very good!

Graphics: 5/5
The 3d graphics for a 2d fighter is pretty impressive and looks beautiful and hi def! Blazblue still has 2d but its made like that on purpose.

Gameplay:5/5
NOT BEGINNER FRIENDLY from the start. I recommend go through tutorial mode. Play some single player and then once you get thebjist of everything, go online and showoff those skills!
Great mechanics and this game is very OFFENSIVE. The more you defend and run away, you get punished badly such a free stun for enemy or losing all your power gauge for your special attacks or recieving 1.5 more damage or double!

This is the most fun game I've played so far.  It is not a great shooter.  Hell no.  Modern Warfare 2 still holds that title.  I would say that this is like GTA on horse-back, but I really didn't like GTA, so I can't say that.  It's not an intense game, it's a fun game that you play as fast & intense or as slow and laid back as you want.

You can pretty much play it however you like.  And I do.  Yea, try that with ""Modern Warfare"" or ""Gears"".  I tend to go kill enough stuff to make enough money to be able to play more poker.

The controls are typical Rockstar - Meaning: they ARE NOT smooth and balanced.  Typical GTA style - weird and unbalanced.  I keep thinking that if Rockstar could combine their open world with a great first person shooter like ""Modern Warfare 2"" or ""Frontlines : Fuel of War"" or ""Rainbow Six: Vegas"" or ""Gears of War"" then WOW, that would be the game of all games.

Like I said, so far so good.  And so far, the funnest game yet.  I have played far more intense games and games that required a lot more attention.  This game is just plane fun.  Many times I just play a few missions, make some money and then give the controller to my wife so she can go play poker for awhile.  Wow, a game that you and your wife can both play....and not necessarily at the same time ;-)

There's an overhwhelming amunt of things you can do with the PS3.  As my title says, I haven't even scratched the surface.

Online gaming is awesome as I haven't done that with my PS2.  Surfing the web with theincluded browser is passable, but you are better off using your computer or an iPhone for web surfing.  Life with Playstation is supposed to be available now (as of 9-18-08).  I have watched one Blu-ray movie so far (Prom Night) and the Blu-ray functionality is great, as long as you buy the remote control.  The PSN (Playstaion Network and Store) is extremely well-done, rivaling and perhaps besting Apple's efforts with the AppleTV.  It is great to be able to download demo games or buy full ones right from your TV.  I picked up a Logitech Blutooth keyboard, which makes entering data easier.  Regular USB keyboards work equally as well.  I also bought a PS3 controller charger that plugs into a wall outlet.  Its nice to always have charged controllers.  I also upgrae my PS3 harddrive to a 320 GB Western Digital Scorpio Black (7200 rpm).  You'll also want a hight qulaity HDMI cable (HDMI and Component cables are not included).  The debate rages on about Monster cables, but I bought their Ultra High Speed for my PS3.

Overall, any PS3 is the best purchase for home entertainment that you can buy.

41420,5.0,False,"05 17, 2003",A52FJFFWZTNFY,B00007M9SI,Robert N. Kallister,"I first got Silent Hill back when it was released in 1998, and I was completely blown away.  The setting was a dark, twisted world of unspeakable horror, with demonic enemies, dark environments, and horrific sound effects that kept me on the edge of my seat through the entire game.  Most of all, it was the first game I'd played that had a full ""town"" you could explore with all the fixings:  signs, lightposts, mailboxes, picnic tables, everything.  Not only that, but the town was doused in a creepy fog, and was without power, so when night fell it was DARK.
When I heard Silent Hill 2 was coming out, I became very excited.  As a huge fan of the Resident Evil series, and owner of the first title, I knew this would be a welcome addition to my library.  And I wasn't disappointed...
You play as James, a lonely man, who lost his wife years ago to an illness, and has gotten a letter recently addressed to him from her.  She says she's waiting for him in their ""special place"" at Silent Hill.  James immediately rushes to the small American town to try to find the reason why he received this letter, and to perhaps bring his late wife Mary back from the dead.
After that, everything goes wild.  You battle an assortment of strange, twisted enemies, and explore the same deserted, dark town for clues and answers to Mary's whereabouts.  You also meet a few survivors, struggling to find their places within Silent Hill's grasp.  People like Eddy, an obese teenager with mental issues, and Angela, a young woman trying to find her family.
The stunning real-life graphics make this game very appealing.  Not only are you able to explore the town in great detail as you did in its predecessor, but now the detail level of the buildings and background is even better.  The cutscenes are done in mastered CGI graphics, with fluid animation that almost looks too real to be done by a computer.
Another feature, which is often taken for granted in games, is the sounds.  Most games have a trite array of sound effects for selecting items, picking stuff up, using them, etc., but they're there mostly because the player knows doing those actions would merit sounds.  In Silent Hill and Silent Hill 2, the sounds are integrated as part of the experience.  The creepy groans of old iron gates, the eerie squelch of your pocket radio when enemies are nearby, the docile music in the background that chills you each step you take.  Definitely keep the sound on when playing this title; it's not the same without it.
The weapon choices have not made a whole lot of progress; you still get the handgun, the shotgun, and the rifle, plus a two-by-four and a steel pole.  Eventually, you get this giant knife that swings real slow, but does an extraordinary amount of damage to enemies, often killing in one hit.  Still, they don't compare with Silent Hill's best weapon, the fire hammer!  A couple swings with that thing tore just about anything up.  Of course, you will also find puzzle items you need to put here and there to go on, as well as keys to open certain doors and gates.
As with any title, Silent Hill 2 is not without its flaws.  The game offers different endings, depending on how your progress went, but none of them really give a solid resolution to the game.  You still feel like there's more of the story to tell.  Also, it's easy to get lost, since the areas are not very well lit.  Plus, some of the puzzles may be confusing, as you're not sure exactly what you're supposed to be doing.  And finally, the main character's (James') voice characterization isn't very good, but I was expecting that.  Harry from Silent Hill wasn't that great either.  I'm thinking this might be done on purpose by the Konami designers, since they did it on both titles, but I'm not sure why.
Overall, I give this title the highest rating I can: a 10 of 10.  Definitely a must-have for anyone who likes to be scared.  But I don't want to necessarily recommend this to Resident Evil fans; if you like the action and fast-pace of the RE series, Silent Hill and Silent Hill 2 are not for you.  The combat scenes are not nearly as frequent, nor as rewarding.  The best aspects of the game are the plot and the atmosphere, not the combat.

Please note that The Last of Us is in digital form - there is a voucher with a code for you to download onto your PS4, while GTA V is a physical disc copy with its own box.

As for the games themselves:

The Last of Us was the best game of the year for the PS3, and the PS4 is just as good, except for an awesome 60 variable fps @ 1080p output video quality. The story/storytelling, mood, and overall ambience is really dark, somber, gritty, and mature-themed. But if you can accept it for what it is, then it is one of the best games of our generation.

GTA V has some early bugs and quirks(especially for online play) that the developers have to work out and patch up, but once it is all fixed, it should be another game of the year contender. There is so much to do and everything looks, plays, and controls great.

294772,5.0,True,"09 8, 2014",A2G5YRJUNLOG63,B00BMFIXT2,Jumpman98,"The only other Assassin's Creed game I had played was the first one and I thought it was a decent enough game. But when I played this, I was just blown away at how much more fun it was. Now, it takes place at the tail end of my favorite period in history, which would be the late 1400s to the late 1600s/early 1700s, which may have affected why I loved this game so much, but it's still a very good game overall. The game takes the naval combat from Assassin's Creed 3 and takes it to a whole new level, making it about half of the gameplay in the game. (the other half being the good ol' fashioned parkour gameplay) I know some people didn't like it, even hated the naval combat. But I for one, really enjoyed it. The open world is pretty huge, but once you've discovered a place, you have the option to fast travel it it immediately. AC 4 also adds a few RPG elements into the game so you can upgrade your ship from only being able to take down the small gunboats and brigs, to taking on the highest lvl Man-o'-War ships in the game. The story is a little unrealistic once you get towards the end, as far as what the treasure the Templars are after, but it's not a bad story in the slightest. Besides the make story, there are TONS of side missions. From ""simple"" assassination contracts, to diving into the depths of the sea and searching sunken shipwrecks. This game offers a lot of replayablity if you are a completionist. Besides the side missions there are also side objectives in *most of* the main missions, Uplay side objectives and of course the Achievements. Like previous entries in the series, you will encounter characters that truly did exist during that time period, such as Stede Bonnet and Captain Blackbeard himself, which is always cool. My only complaint I have for this game is the loading times can be a little too long for my taste. You'll have to wait up to 20 seconds at sometimes, and it's just annoying.

While it's all very enjoyable, it could have easily been a part of the complete package, and I won't justify it with any more space than this blurb, on principle.)

The Arkham series isn't that fresh anymore. When Arkham Asylum came out, it was a burst of creativity and a testament to how licensed games could actually work if done right. And when Arkham City was released, it took the established framework and used it to make one of the definitive open-world titles of the last generation of consoles. But now? Times have changed. Origins was very solid, but not exceptional, and Blackgate barely worth mentioning. The basic gameplay of the franchise has been aped so many times that it now feels tired. And grim, dark, brooding superheroes are becoming a bit passe. The times have changed since 2009.

For better or worse, Rocksteady has changed with them.

To my surprise, Arkham Knight manages to pull off the unthinkable and avoid the pits of sequelitis. At no point during my several, several hours of playtime have I stopped to think that this was more of the same. In fact, I'm duly impressed with how different everything is. While the basic ideas of combat and gadgetry usage are mostly intact, roughly everything else has been changed. To an extent, it almost feels like Rocksteady saw how much of a retread Origins was, then decided to push Knight into almost absurdly different territory for the sake of being original. ""A"" for effort, I suppose.

Thing is, that effort actually pays off more often than not. It starts at the most basic level: the narrative. While the story itself feels somewhat conventional, the way in which it's told is easily the most interesting I've seen in a game this year. What should be a formulaic, ""Batman has to stop a big bad bomb and take out a big bad guy"" experience turns into something that delves into psychological horror. This is a Batman that's clearly traumatized from all the horrible stuff he's been through, and it's starting to get to him. Add in some of antagonist Scarecrow's nerve gas and you've got a volatile, damaged antihero whose quest for justice is constantly thwarted by his own mind. That is to say, the way he sees the world isn't quite how it actually is.

And this is what makes Arkham Knight so particularly effective in the story department. Time and space start bending in the most bizarre ways possible. Players will pan the camera around Batman, then back around only to find that the room has changed, or that a new character is standing there. People that die may or not actually be dead, and major narrative events might not actually be happening. After the introductory bits, Rocksteady's swan song for the Dark Knight turns into an often unnerving descent into the darkest corners of its protagonist's mind. Players are simply yanked along for the ride, at the mercy of what's one of the darkest Batman stories ever told.

Of course, no story is perfect, and Arkham Knight's certainly has some glaring flaws. Some twists end up getting blatantly telegraphed and dampen the surprise. The cast is a bit bloated and ends up feeling packed full of characters that don't necessarily need to be there. And, most importantly to me, every female member of the cast is put in some sort of captivity at some point. Some might take issue with me pointing this out, but it needs to be stated. The source material has some really interesting female characters, and the way all of them get represented here is sorely lacking. I won't go into much more details at risk of spoiling anything, but it really ground my gears to see some of my favorite characters only get utilized as lazy motivation for Batman to do a thing.

That isn't to say that the overall story in Arkham Knight isn't good, because good lord, it's excellent. Despite those particular flaws that stuck like a sore thumb, I quite enjoy the main narrative brunt of the game, and think it's one of the better ones put on the market this year. Add on the fact that every side mission has its own sort of important narrative, and you've got a lot of content to sink your teeth into. Overall, from a narrative enjoyment standpoint, this is definitely a solid win.

Rocksteady innovated the brawler with Asylum, but with so many other games aping the simple, fast-paced combat of that title these days, does it hold up here? Surprisingly, yes. The developer has gotten the formula down to a near-art. It's still basically a series of intuitive, timed button presses, but the accompanying visuals, different sets of abilities and new varieties of enemies make things much more interesting. Also helping is the introduction of other characters into the mix. Playing through a good portion of the various missions, I've taken control of 5-6 unique characters, all of whom play a little differently. This keeps the combat interesting, snappy, and full of different elements that managed to take me by surprise.

Stealth segments are also a vast improvement over what they have been before. In previous entries, stealth has been required at times, but often felt like it progressed in a very closed, linear sort of way. In Arkham Knight, it's become an impressively dynamic system. Enemies are constantly chattering, always adapting to whatever strategy you're adopting. They'll bomb vents, rip floor panels up, and use sonar. They can tell if you hit somebody from above or at ground level, even if they didn't see you do it. Players have to use every ability at their disposal in order to stay hidden in the large stealth playgrounds the game provides. To be honest, this never feels like you're playing a stealth game; it feels like you're trying to hide from real, thinking human beings who start learning your every move. Of course, there are some fun and funny little things players can exploit to easily win, but the illusion of actual intelligence is fairly palpable here.

Any semblance of realism goes out the window with the introduction of the Batmobile, however. Critics are divided on this addition and I'm going to be up front: this is my favorite part of Arkham Knight outside of the story, hands down. To be blunt, the Batmobile is one of the most improbable, stupid vehicles ever put in a video game, and doesn't behave according to any rational laws of physics... in the best way possible. Steel beams crumble like cardboard by just bumping the thing into them. It can drive upside down with minimal acceleration. It's often used for environmental puzzles, such as scaling a wall with a cable or counterbalancing a scale to make a ramp. If it isn't obvious already, I'm trying to say that the Batmobile is used in the most counter-intuitive, hammy ways possible, and I honestly can't get enough of it.

But wait, there's more! The Batmobile also transforms into an agile tank for some of the game's most fun sequences. The streets of Gotham are filled with unmanned drone tanks, and the only way to take them out is by blowing them to pieces with machine guns and shells. Player have to boost out of the way of incoming shots, fire off barrages of missiles, and just wreak general havoc among enemies. It's some of the most fun I've had in a vehicle in a game since Grand Theft Auto V hit shelves.

I appreciate what the Batmobile adds to the experience because it reminds players that they're playing a video game. Too many games these days try to be realistic and gritty and bleak. Here, things go from zero to stupid in one second as soon as you step into the Batmobile. Things careen through the air while the vehicle flips and bounces without abandon and any semblance of immersion goes out the window. And I mean that in a good way. If I want to drive a car, I'll go drive a car. If I want to jump a car/tank hybrid between skyscrapers while it flips for no reason and is also firing missiles, I'll play a video game. And it's not like it controls poorly. It's totally accurate to every twitch of your finger. The Batmobile is some of the most fun I've had in a virtual vehicle in way too long, and the sheer variety of stupid stuff you can do in it never ceases to bring a smile to my face.

Despite the funny break in realism with the Batmobile, however, the visuals never cease to arrest and pull you right into the action. In terms of graphical fidelity and performance, Arkham Knight might be the most impressive game of this generation so far. Character's faces are convincing without treading into Uncanny Valley territory, as are different fabrics and textures. It's striking. The environments are also impressive, in particular the billowing water that surrounds all of the islands of Gotham, and the practically lifelike clouds of poison toxin that get shown off later on in the game. What I don't like is that this is still a game that mostly takes place in the dark, and the color scheme is relatively limited. It's arresting overall, yes, but I guess I'm sick of that color scheme in modern games, and am spoiled by the several dozen hours I've put into both Splatoon and The Witcher 3 in the past few weeks, both of which are very colorful. Still, Arkham Knight is an impressive technical achievement overall, and even more so considering that the frame rate practically never dips while rendering everything.

Once last thing to note is the fantastic voice acting. And I do mean fantastic. As in, premature shoe-in for several, several voice acting awards. Kevin Conroy returns as Batman, and carries the character with a nuance and gravity that we haven't seen before. Troy Baker is does a stellar job as Arkham Knight, and this is speaking as somebody who's a bit sick of the guy, But, by and far, the two scenestealers are John Noble as Scarecrow and Mark Hamill as Joker. The former is a haunting, vindictive sociopath with an approach that's horrifically methodical, and Noble does an eerily good job nailing it down without coming across as hammy or forced. And Hamill... well, what else is there to say about him that hasn't been said? The man's a legend, and his turns as the Clown Prince of Crime here are among his best and most psychotic (mostly thanks to the M rating.) While I won't say what capacity he appears in outside of ""flashbacks,"" rest assured that you're in for a real treat.

A ""real treat"" is probably the best description of Batman: Arkham Knight  I can think of. There are some niggling complaints that prevent me from gushing praise of it being ""the most next-gen game ever"" (which doesn't even mean anything,) but overall, it's just straight-up fun. It's a blast zipping around rooftops as Batman. It's a joy getting totally blindsided and startled by visual trickery straight out of something like P.T. (RIP.) It's pure dumb fun doing literally anything with the Batmobile. Arkham Knight has some issues, sure, but for a AAA game to come out, be functional, and most of all, not feel like contrived, focus-tested garbage... well, that's pretty great.

Trashy DLC practices and narrative hiccups aside, Batman: Arkham Knight does a skillful job of ending one of gaming's most popular story arcs and avoiding any serious feelings of ""sameness"" brought on by being the fourth game in a franchise. Rocksteady is clearly one of the the best devs in the business, and I'm looking forward to whatever new IP they work on next.

Pros:

301504,5.0,False,"10 14, 2014",A3BMSRC38L9AKV,B00CJXYTGM,Particle Ghost,"I would like to begin this review by stating that even though Shinji Mikami created the Resident Evil franchise, it is still owned by the company Capcom. Do to this aspect, it would be an accurate assumption to assume that over time, Capcom was highly restricting his potential, by regulating his final products, in order to capitalize on the sales of what was forming into a cash cow series, or in other words, making his games appeal more for the masses. After his departure from Capcom, and moving on to form his own studio known as Tango Gameworks, he is now free to work at his own discretion. I would like to think of The Evil Within as ""his dream come true"", as he gathers all of his cumulative experiences into one complete package. So, after all of these years in the field, does he have any tricks left up his sleeves? Lets find out.

The Evil Within is about a detective, Sebastian Castellanos, who witnesses a hooded figure massacring fellow police officers one by one, and after being attacked, he later wakes up finding himself trapped in a land where dangerous creatures dwell and has to fight his way through the world of death in order to understand what is going on. The game does feature other characters that present themselves at times during the story, and so far it is definitely interesting, although I desire to leave these aspects as being untold. The Evil Within is a game that returns back to the original roots of survival horror. The player will find themselves lurking around a mysterious manor with plenty of creepy occult stuff to be found.

The player will be faced with dead bodies, loads of gore, ammo that is very scarce, plenty of dark lighting with tons of scares, and puzzles that force the player to stop and ponder the moment. Simply put, it features everything that the player would want coming from the creator of Resident Evil, and we could say that it reconciles any broken relationships after being hit with almost an entire decade of death to the survival horror genre. It plays much like the older Resident Evil games, with all of the mechanics brought up to our current standards. Another game I could compare it with is an older classic known as Alone In The Dark, with a small sprinkle of Clock Tower, Silent Hill, and Outlast tossed into the mix.

Some of the Haunted are invisible, the environments are laced with traps, and at times the game has a heavy focus on stealth, avoiding enemies completely when ever possible, which is why I have mentioned The Last of Us. Players who have played The Last of Us will feel right at home when it comes down to the stealth and shooting mechanics, even down to the very core of tossing items into the environment that can be used to distract opponents.

I really enjoyed The Last of Us, however, by the time that I finished it,  I found myself saying, if only there was some more Infected here and there, if only it was a little darker here and there, and if only it was more creepy here and there. That didn't make it a bad game, its just that the parts where it did feature the Infected went by very quickly, and it only contained a few parts with dark lighting and creepy atmosphere. When Naughty Dog did go there, they did it profoundly well, so it always left me wanting more in those regards. Basically, The Evil Within fulfills those urges I was looking for. It is like playing a made from scratch version of the original Resident Evil, with stealth that resembles The Last of Us tossed into the mix, and then it takes those scare factors and cranks them up about 10 fold.

I will say that even though the game features stealth, it is not designed to be played like Splinter Cell. This means that the game is set up with the option to use stealth as an advantage when given, but it does not feature pure stealth, it does force the player into facing many confrontations. Now some people, including myself, have been questioning about how fluid the shooting and character movements would be, and I would say that it's great, as long as the player can understand the viewpoint of the protagonist. Unlike the Resident Evil series and other games that focus on highly trained agents where players are part of special forces with plenty of practice in the use of firearms and machine guns, the main character of The Evil Within is a detective.

Shinji Mikami definitely has the skill it takes to offer those tight shooting controls, but he simply didn't want to program the game as a run and gun as he did with his tactical shooter known as Vanquish. With that said, everything controls well, and the clumsy feeling the game portrays is done deliberately and is intended to make the player feel a little helpless, and not in any way the case of bad programming. Let us also get one thing out in the open, in order to not disappoint those that may have expectations in playing a shooting gallery. If you are looking for a shooter, do not buy this game, this is not a game that focuses on shooting. Yes, it does have weapons, but the game is less about searching for a kill and more about being hunted and trying to find a way to survive, and that's the way it was intended.

Your gun, just as in real life, should not, and is not, the focal point of your survival. There are a multitude of traps set throughout the game, and players are able to use those traps in order to defeat enemies. You can use your gun of course, but the game is set up so you don't have much ammo, so the game invites players to create strategic ways to survive, using traps, stealth, and observing your surroundings. The player has access to weapons such as a knife, revolver, shotgun, sniper rifle, grenades, the Agony Crossbow, and players can also assign weapon shortcuts. The bow is multi- functioning, and fires bolts capable of blinding, freezing, electrocuting or exploding enemies.

Even with ammunition being scarce, components can be harvested to craft additional bolts. There is melee combat and it is designed to create distance between the player and enemies, but the player can instantly kill some unaware enemies after sneaking up on them.  If the player does happen to down an enemy, even if left decapitated, they are capable of reviving, and as I stated before, enemies must be set on fire with the use of matches, and as one might suspect, the player has only a limited supply of matches. This is a good aspect, as it implies that players can't simply Mike Tyson their way through the game.

Enemies include the Haunted, the main enemies of the game, and they act in the same manner as zombies but can also wield weapons. There is also the Boxman, a big creature who uses a large hammer. There is the RE-Bone Laura, a creature that resembles a woman with multiple limbs. There is the Butcher, a deranged human who butchers its victims and loves to chase Sebastian with a chainsaw. Last but not least, there is the Ruvik, a hooded man that can appear randomly throughout the game, and getting close to him can result in an instant death. There are also boss fights scattered throughout the game.

Health regenerates only to a small degree, and medical items are used to restore health, and some can cause temporary hallucinogenic effects. There are also green vials throughout the game that players can use to upgrade certain abilities, and players can expect to come across the occasional lore that serves in luring the player into its world.

As for presentation, it is nothing less than superb. The sound is spot on, the enemy A.I is spot on, the art direction is spot on, the pacing is spot on, the lighting and shadows are spot on, the controls are spot on, the menu navigation's are spot on, and the balance in difficulty is very well thought out. It also comes with an instruction manual and a inside over art, something games rarely even come with anymore. The game also seems to run very well, as it utilizes the id Tech 5 engine. I must say that the engine suits the game very well, giving the entire experience a very nitty gritty feel. The graphics are intended to give a macabre, nightmarish feel, and are not meant to be bright and shiny, or look better than some high profile games being released, the focus is to evoke dread.

The environments are also extremely well thought out, and there is much more to it than running around the confines of an old manor. There are situations where you start out in a hallway but end up in a different world. For those who are not informed regarding the id Tech 5 engine, lets just say that the engine is really hardcore, capable of Virtual Texturing, which can support textures of a completely dynamic and changeable world. This technique allows the engine to automatically stream textures into memory as needed, meaning that developers don't need to worry themselves with memory restraints or texture limits.

The engine automatically optimizes resources for cross-platform development, making it possible to render the same models on different platforms, while creating them for only one platform. This method greatly simplifies cross-platform development, meaning more focus can be used in creating a great game, without needing to cut corners for inferior systems. The engine also has numerous other advanced features, such as volume-based shadows, high-dynamic-range lighting, radiosity, and much more. I believe that Shinji Mikami made a good decision with using this engine, and he wanted to make sure that if anything had to be limited, it would be his imagination, not the imposed restrictions from being tied down with a restrictive engine.

I'm going to bring this review to its closing, and end it by saying a few small things. As far as replay value is concerned, for a horror game, it definitely does amaze. It features enough freedom and randomized elements to keep the player coming back for more, with a world that fully immerses the player into its realms. I do not see any online features, so the game is definitely dedicated for the single player experience, and I didn't pick up the season pass, so no comments regarding that aspect. The game also features a very limited HUD, giving the player complete focus of the game, and it is completely adjustable from the options menu. The player can turn many different features on or off, allowing them to absolutely play how they desire.

Also let it be known that the game features a 2:35:1 aspect ratio that is not as bad as I suspected, and players as myself who are using a widescreen can simply force the aspect ratio into filling the full screen, a definite plus side for people who own one. The game also has a great mix of stealth gameplay and action, knowing when to switch between the two, as well as transitioning between night and day locations accordingly. It also knows how to leave you alone and let you play, without interrupting the player with cinematics around every corner.

It also has a new game plus feature as well as unlockable difficulties, extra weapons and a gallery mode. The extra difficulties take the game to an entirely different level, and can challenge even the most hardcore of the hardcore. I have played the nightmare setting, and lets just say that enemies are more numerous, stronger, move faster, and there are less resources, pushing even experienced  players to their limits. If that's not good enough, there is even the Akumu mode, that features a one hit and you die experience.

+ Graphics are GREAT- Cars/tracks/menus everything
+ Drafting at Daytona/Talladega is so realistic VERY fun
+ Selection of drivers is good (Will be even better with the 2011 patch)
+ FINALLY multiplayer on the ps3 for nascar
++++ the big one+++ CUSTOM CARS are so cool... you can design anything... have 1000 layers for your cars and you have 20 slots for cars+ u can pick any number

Emperor: Battle for Dune is a great, fun game that is everything Dune 2000 should have been.

The units may not have very many polys, but they are well animated and have tons of little details, like the Atreides sniper's laser and the elite Sardukar slitting the throats of his opponents.
The game is also true to the Dune novels. As in the books, shields and lasers don't mix: hit a shielded unit with a lasgun and you are treated to a very nice graphical effect that unfortunatley results in the explosive deaths of both units. The fremen are back with their sandworm-riding antics, in addition to the four other subhouses that add variety to your army. Each of the three main sides are totally different, too.

Most of the Kirby games are addicting, easy, simple, and short. The addicting, simple, and easy attributes make the Kirby games wonderful for any gamer, but the short length of most of the Kirby games doesn't apply to those more interested in gaming. This Kirby game is addicting, easy to pick up (hard to master), and with a depthness to gameplay and a long time to complete makes this the greatest Kirby game of all time.
There's not much of a story to Kirby Air Ride, but that's to be expected, because (with the exception of Canvas Curse) none of the Kirby games have really had a story. The game is fast paced, but little ones and older ones alike can easily pick up on the one button gameplay.
Anyone can get all that they want from this game. For those looking for 15 minutes of fun, easily done. For those looking for a nice long game, the checklist of accomplishments will keep any gamer sitting around for a long time trying to complete them.
The genre of this game is hard to explain. Somehow, the creators meshed racing with standard Kirby style so well, that there's only one word for the genre: KIRBYRACING!
This is a game that needs to be on any gamer's shelf, or even for people who don't consider themselves gamers who just want a fun game. This is one of my favorite games of all time.

First of all, the graphics are smooth and pretty close to reality.
I have it hooked to a Sony Bravia 32"" (you can get one for $600!!!) and its amazing. I use an HDMI cable.
You turn it on from your couch, just press the PS button on your controller and it launches. You can also turn it off from your controller.
If you have a surround sound system with an optical cable, you can set the PS3 to translate the signal to DTS automatically! For some reason DTS sounds more life-like and powerful than Dolby 5.1, and it will literally make your room rumble.
It doesn't matter if your game only has Dolby encoding, it will output in DTS (or you can set it to outpot in Dolby. Your choice)
Blue ray movies look and sound way better than DVDs. Although, the PS3 upconverts the DVDs to look pretty close to blue-ray. They look pretty close. In fact, you barely notice, unless the movie is shot in digital format.
The games are huge, becasue blu-ray discs can store many times more data than DVDs.
I have one problem though, that sometimes the screen turns green after or before watching a movie. I don't know why, but once I restart the console, it will dissapear. Its a small glitch.
If you have internet, you can get into the free HOME interface and interact, play and meet other people (similar to SecondLife, although you can't buy real estate or transfer cash to other people. Its strictly to meet and play with people).
You can acces the Sony store to buy and download dozens of games or even movies in HD. They're not expensive. You can usually rent a movie for a few dollar for a day, or you can even buy it and store it in your system.
And everything you do online is FREE. You don't have to pay a big monthly subscription like in the ""other"" competitor.
The controller is wireless, and it doesn't have rumble effect. But you can buy on separately with that feature.
I haven't had the time to use its features fully. But I know you can install Linux in it, and I'm going to try it.
You can browse the internet with its included browser. You can even get into Youtube and make the video screen BIG to fit your TV. I think that's and awesome feature. Hulu.com works great also and you can watch whole TV shows and even moves, and they look better than regular TV because many times they're 480i HD.

It doensn't have memory stick slots (this 40 gb model) but I don't need them ,because I can even transer file with a USB memory stick or a burned CDRom.
It just has too many features too list. Its very versatily and Sony is constanlty updating the software FOR FREE. I have even seen games in the Playstation Network store for $2.99, and some are even free.
But whatever, I don't really care what you choose in the end, its your money and you can blow it on a 360 or a Wii *laughs*, heck $20 a month for XBox live isn't much anyway, that's just $240 a year hahaha... later",The best console so far.,1243728000,,"{'Size:': ' 17.5 x 14 x 7 inches', 'Color:': ' black'}",

The SP is also much better than the standard GBA because the clamshell design prevents scratching if you're carrying it around in your pocket and the screen is backlit for increased viewing clarity.

With the Nintendo DS out there now the GBA SP is a bit redundant as you can play GBA games on the SP. But don't worry, there are still loads of games getting made for it and the GBA can play all the old Gameboy and Gameboy Color games, which the DS cannot.

White,"While SMT:N has a storyline that is a tad controversial due to it's strange take on Christianity and other-worldly religions, it takes a stealar apparoach on old RPG principles and builds on them! The game features an interesting turn based combat system with ""button press icons"", which diminish as you take a turn. If you manage to score a critical hit or use an enemey's weakness though, you only use up one half of a turn press icon, so in theory you can end up going twice as many turns per round in combat (and possibly never let your oppoenent take a turn if you manage to kill them before your turns are used up!) The press turn system works for your opponent in the same way though, so look out. A down side to this revamped 'old fashioned' combat system though is that if your main character dies, you lose. This is an old rpg rule that many can probably recall in games from the past.

The heart of the game though is the monster/demon creation/recruitment system. Throughout the game, you will encounter tons of different monsters, of all shapes and sizes. Each of them have different combonations of strengths, weaknesses, skills and abilities. To obtain them, you will have to either recruit them in combat via negotiation, purchase them from vendors, or fuse your old monsters to create new ones in the Cathedral of Shadows (which is what you will probably end up doing most of the time in the end.)

The game states that it has over 55 hours of gameplay, but you could easily go into the 100's if you end up looking for all of the extra content in the game. In order to obtain the added ending in this 'director's cut' version of the game, you will have to embark on some rather lengthy side quests and also will have to create a tremendously powerful party if you are to ever have a hope of battling the awsome final boss that the game has hidden away. Definently a fun challange for those who have patience.

This game features a wonderful soundtrack, which eminates techno, rock, metal, and ambient tunes. It is mostly upbeat, and it's sound effects are also very well placed in. Sadly, there is no voice acting, but it helps out in the end with the 'old school' feel that the game has. The graphics are also wonderful, as they are done in a unique and un-childish cell-shaded manner the likes of which I have never seen until now.

Another positive is that the game features Dante from the Devil May Cry series, whom many gamers will probably be familiar with (as was I. In fact, he was the main reason I bought the game!)

SMT:Nocturne is a rare game, and it will be hard to come by at a price under $50 dollars, but believe me, it is very well worth the price of admission if you are looking for a GOOD RPG.",Excellent old-school action RPG!,1118620800,13,,

If it's been a while then you might want to give Rayman Origins a try. For me this game brings back a lot of fond memories of a time when side-scrolling games ruled the consoles and controls were not overly complicated. At the same time though, this game has a pretty good amount of depth.

Upon initially looking at the cover art it might be easy to dismiss this game thinking it's just cartoony and only kids would enjoy it, but there's a lot going on here! Rayman Origins has very beautiful graphics throughout. The art and level concepts really kept me wanting to see what was next. Each level brings something new and sometimes hilarious. Another standout feature of this game is how perfectly the music and sound effects match Rayman and his lovable team. Thankfully there are some challenging levels that test your'e ability and timing when it comes to running, jumping, floating and the occasional puzzle. The co-op feature is a blast and perfect for playing with my nine year old. Being able to drop in and out of the game without having to quit and go back to the main title screen really helps the experience.

Having never played a Rayman game before I was a little hesitant to spend $49 on it. Especially this year when there has been a major game release almost every couple of weeks. I'm really glad I bought this game. Playing through the tons of levels has brought back my appreciation for games that do everything right.

Too often, we see the same ol' run of your average game that's okay to play on the PSP but nothing never turly entertaining. In Dead Head Fred, you play as Detective Fred Neuman who starts his adventure after getting himself killed by a local mob boss. Brought back to life by Dr. Steiner, Fred finds himself missing his memory and his head. As Dead Head Fred, it's up to you to uncover the mystery behind his death, save the city, and be the hero by the end of the game. Oh, and lop off a few heads in the meantime, lol. Over the course of the game, Fred will come to own a collection of no less than eight different heads, not counting the bell jar he starts the game with. Fred can swap out heads on the fly, giving him access to a variety of different powers and abilities. Trust me, it's alot more entertaining than it sounds. When you first start playing, the game seems more like an Action/Platform game of sorts but it turns into much much more. The controls are dead-on, gameplay is simple yet complex enough to keep things fresh in the game for you. Graphics look pretty good for a PSP game, although nothing truly spectacular.

The game is perfect to play in short bursts but, if you play for long periods of time, look for it to become a little repetitive. It's never repetitive enough to mar the game, though. That's about all I could find wrong with the game.

Dead Head Fred has the makings to be a sleeper hit on the PSP but will probably see the same fate most games of this sort do(take, for example, Beyond Good and Evil or Psychonauts). It will fall under the radar & never see a sequel. I hope and pray I'm wrong. Dead Head Fred is a delightful change of pace that's creative & fun and deserving of a sequel. Lesser creative games(like Death Jr., I'm afraid) have seen sequels, why not Dead Head Fred?? In my opinion, it is money well spent.

It was quite a surprise to see Namco bring it to the Gameboy Advance yet I'm glad they did. It looks and plays exactly like the PS1 version(although with more of an isometric perspective,like the GBA Spyro games & Banjo-Kazooie, lucky me) and, even though it's an older game, is an absolute blast to play through. See, Toc-Man has kidnapped Pac-Man's friends, like Ms. Pac-Man, Pac Jr., and so on, and it's up to Pac-Man(that's you) to rescue them.

So, if you're a gamer who likes playing games more in the GBA Spyro, Banjo-Kazooie & Rayman(Hoodlum Havoc) vein... you definitely need to look this one up. Namco did a wonderful job with this one. So much so, that I look forward to getting Pac-Man World 2 for the system.

I know that there are a handful of controllers out there that have XInput, which is necessary to the operation of many current PC games, but still a majority require either great manipulation and fixes or some kind of third-party program to run in Steam. The SteelSeries 3GC will absolutely not work with Windows 8.1 and they've made sure third-party PS3 controllers don't work, so you're relegated to some kind of dark science to get these to operate in 8.1, or use a Microsoft-friendly device.

There is just so much to love about this game and ultimetaly it really is one of the most entertaining racing games I have ever played.

One of the most distinctive aspects to this game is the ""checking traffic"". Instead of dodging same way traffic, your supposed to hit them and thus ""check"" them out of the way. When you check a car it sends it flying a couple hundred feet ahead and ultimately its a great way of taking an opponent down, if you can time it right. I admit, like others on here have, that initially it was very difficult to hit the cars. I have been playing racing games for as long as they have been making them and I would instinctively dodge the cars even tho I was purposely trying to hit them. It definitely took some getting used to but, once you do, it adds a whole new element to this series. There is an event specifically aimed at checking called ""Traffic Attack"". You have to cause a specific amount of damage by checking cars. You have a 30 second timer and checking traffic adds time back onto the timer. These were some of the more difficult events in Burnout Revenge.

Another new event is the ""Crashbreaker"". When you get taken out you can detonate your car and take out any cars still near you. Detonating your car takes away all of your stored up turbo boost and this is what really makes the ""cashbreaker"" events so great cause if you detonate and miss, your going to be struggling to catch back up. If you detonate and take out an opponents car, it rewards you by recharging your turbo boost and immediately putting your car right back into the race at high speed. Usually when you crash you have to wait a few seconds before you can start up again and you start up at a very slow speed. The crashbreaker events are easily some of the most entertaining events in this game.

Some other events include Crash events (try to cause as much damage to specific settings as possible), Burning Lap (basic timed race), Eliminator (race where the last place position gets taken out every 30 seconds), and of course the classic road rage which you have to take out a specific number of opponents in a given time. IMO this is the best set of events we have seen yet from this series and ultimately the diversity of the race events is really one of the strongest aspects to this game.

My only complaint with this game lies with the cars. There are no brand name cars in this game. They are all generic cars with very generic names. You will find yourself winning cars and not really remembering, or caring for that matter, which cars you won or have at your disposal. They all kind of just blend together. Most of the time you will just pick the car that the program recommends. Basically it just makes you not care about whats in your garage. I understand that it would have cost a significant amount of money to have real brand name cars in this game so its a problem that is easily forgiven. Some companies don't even allow their cars to be used in games that have damage.

Bottom line - Burnout Revenge is not only one of the best games in the series, its also one of the best arcade style racers ever made. If your a fan of this style racing game and you haven't played this yet then you should immediately run out and buy it, especially given the fact that you can now pick it up for 20 bucks or less.",One of the Most Entertaining Racing Games in Years!!!,1292630400,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

Good stuff... glide on your cape, use your chains, use all sorts of nasty weapons, use AGONY (Spawn's Ax), upgrade your health and necro powers...

It's a long game to complete, and it does have fair replayability due to being able to go back and complete previous missions (to try and unlock comic books, etc).

It's 3rd person view and you can lock-on to enemies or just slash around, either works. The best is when the enemy is small enough and you grab them with your chains, then rip them apart.

The good, bad, and ugly of the game:

(The Good): It's got Spawn. 'Nuff said. Great use of his powers, cape, ax, and chains. It's a lot of fun using your chains to grab a ledge/enemy, whatever.

(The Bad): Sometimes it's difficult to figure out where to go. This can be frustrating. Or at least how to get there. A lot of times you find yourself doing a leap of faith to get to it. And then you have to start over at the previous checkpoint (hopefully not too far).

excellent ringwalks, and every single fighter has his own specific ring walk which is something Knockout Kings doesn't have.

All I can do is tell you what I did and didn't like about the game plus my personal overall opinion about the title.

To keep it short, the game is, in my honest opinion, one of the best titles to be released for the Xbox 360 this year. Not only that, I'd even go so far as to say that this installment of the Halo series has the best or at least, the most entertaining story to date of any single one. It plays like a noir film set in a sci-fi future universe, complete with dark streets, neon lights, tall skyscrapers and a mystery to be solved. It manages to be its own entity in a world that most people associate Master Chief with as its main focus of what makes the series such a success. I found this story to be the easiest to follow and enjoyed my time spent with the characters in the story. You get to spend a bit of time with each one in segments that present some pretty intense battles in varying locales and scenarios. It's a Halo game through and through, the one difference this time being that you're not gonna feel so invincible  'cause you're not a Spartan. I really enjoyed the story and thought it fit very well and not as an eyesore on the rest of the Halo timeline. And playing it over Live with three other players in co-op makes it even more enjoyable. The voice acting is well done and its cool to see Nathan Fillion of Firefly fame putting in some screentime as the game's main character (of sorts). I'd also like to say, this one has some of the best music in the series. My hats off to the Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori for putting together a score that I already own.

Control is typical Halo sans dual wielding. You do get to carry more grenades and employ a pretty nice accessory in the form of a visor that gives the player an advantage in highlighting borders on objects such as cars, walls and general objects while enemies are highlighted red making them easier to pinpoint. The graphics are Halo style all the way and if you thought that the graphics for Halo 3 were at least passable, you'll probably feel the same way with this one as well.

There's also a great mode called Firefight which most likely will get compared to Gears of War 2's Horde mode where you survive wave after waves of increasingly stronger enemies. If you liked it then, you'll love it now as it's every bit of much fun as Horde was. In my opinion, this mode is worth owning the game for just on its own value.

All I can say is, if you like Halo in the least, there's no way you can get disappointed by this. While the campaign is admittedly a bit short, clocking in somewhere between 7-10 hours depending on how much time you invest in achieving all the game has to offer, it still provides a decent challenge while playing in Legendary difficulty. Again, multiplayer co-op in either campaign or firefight mode is a blast. I loved every minute of this.","Don't listen to anyone, not even me",1254096000,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

i am now half way threw the game and the story is amazing. the disisions you make effect everything so you really choose how the story goes. i am so into the story i just wish i could play more. you get to choose between 4 different classes at one point and i chose spy. i try to get my spy all the way up cause i am one of those people that don't try to kill unless i have to. the hacking system is fun and i like the lock picking. it gets better because you can unlock stuff to help you out. at first it can be frustrating because of the timelimit, but just take you time and watch what your doing. i shooting is great from the criticle shots and everything. with a critical shot you aim in and it gradually gets smaller till its a pimpoint on there head. a criticle shot is pretty much a one shot kill. you have different kinds of bullets from tranquilizers to silent bullets for you asssalt riffle. the ai is pretty easy and sometimes they can be dumb. but its not different then anyother stealth game i have ever played. i just think this is a great game and it might be because i love steath games and this is my kind of game. i would say atleast give it a rental because i could see how everyone wouldnt like the game. this is not a game for everyone, but if you like games like splinter cell and like developing your character and having control over the story you will love this game. now this game is nothing like splintercell its just the same concept on stealth. hope this review helps.",3ps stealth and rpg = amazing game,1275436800,6,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

You will find 3 seperate campaigns, one each for the Aliens, Predators, and Colonial Marines.  Each race plays totally different from the other - the Marine is closest to standard shoot-em up FPS and also the movies, the Predator has lots of stealth missions and jumping from tree to tree while on the hunt, and the Alien - well, I won't ruin it for you, but the Alien campaign is certainly the most creative I've seen since Half-life.
The resemblance to the films is uncanny.  While AvP2's story doesn't much resemble anything from the movies, the developers have taken many themes, locations and situations from the films and plugged them into the game, so that you are often replaying a moment that will remind you of something.  The plot is wonderful, as each campaign, although self-contained, gives little details about the other two.  When you finally finish the game, you'll definitely want to play through again, just like watching Sixth Sense a 2nd time to catch all of the details.
My only complaints are that the game is too linear and the enemies are too predicable on the second or third time through.

Creative beyond a shadow of a doubt. 95 % of people agree, that Banjo-Kazooie is a landmark title with everything the N64 has to offer, and that it is worthy of 5 out of 5 stars . While developed early in N64's lifespan, the graphics stand out beyond many titles recently released. The sound is equally as impressive (for N64), and the game has been cleverly melded with it to make you feel as the atmosphere of the game has changed, depending on your situation.
I am proud to say many people love this game. Many of my friends still play it occasionally, however few have beaten it all the way. This game is solid for 50+ hours of gaming, but only when you are willing to get every last puzzle piece and musical note, and every other item. Some people dislike it, and do not be fooled; a 27 year male old who listens to ultra-hard rock and loves games with extreme violence and/or nudity will NOT like this game. It is by no means for everybody. Many gamers, from preschool to high school will like it, but not everybody.
The controls are easy enough to master, and any avid or casual gamer will easily master them with a little practice. The sound is superb. The graphics are good, for an N64 title. There is not a dull moment in this game, and the attention to detail is amazing. The puzzles, the meat of the game, are easy enough for older kids to have a challenge and not to hard for younger kids. The puzzle peices, your reward for completeing a puzzle, are well hidden. The musical notes, the only way to advance to the next portion of the overworld, are challenging to find. The most fun part of the game, visiting Mumbo, is quite enjoyable. He transforms you into various forms. A fat walrus, a termite, and even a bumble bee. There isn't really an advancing story, but that's okay. You get an occasional cinematic, but it's pretty basic.
The story goes...
The evil witch, Gruntilda, is happily hanging out atop her mountain WHEN... The ""cute"" Tootie, sister of Banjo the bear, strolls by. Overcome with jealousy, she sees Tootie is quite a bit ""cuter"" than her. So she kidnapps Banjo's sister and creates a machine to suck Tootie's ""cuteness"" out and put it into her. Banjo and his sidekick breegull, Kazooie set off to find Tootie. A mole named Bottles helps them learn some new moves to defeat various obsticles in the game.

There's also a very unexpected twist towards the end of the game where you see the world in a whole set of different eyes that was just a complete mind warp. I won't give that away as it's too great of a part to expect, you'll just have to see what I'm talking about!

131130,5.0,False,"08 13, 2011",A23XABNYXBZ08B,B00136MBHA,Adol A.,"This is a great game. Basically, you run around for 3 weeks trying to accomplish missions set by the 'Reapers' who then try to kill you, or stop you by sending creatures called 'Noise' after you. Basically, you complete the missions, fight the Reapers, and beat the game.

That's the short version of it. However, there's more to it than just that. You level up in this game, but it only levels up your HP. To level up your attack, defense, bravery, etc, you eat food. However you can only eat 24 ""bytes"" a day, though the last 6 always stay open, so you can eat foods that only take 6 bytes as much as you want, until you beat the game and get a sticker that lets you eat all the food you want. You can decrease your HP by 50 (which is how much one level gives you) down to the HP you'd have at level 1, to increase your drop rate, which is unique.

Another unique system are the pins that you use to fight with. That's right. Pins. Who needs keyblades or buster swords when you can just use these magical pins that either emit lightning, fire, pick up obstacles and throw them at enemies, and whatnot. Also, there's over 300 of these things to master, and 3 different ways to get PP for your pins (PP is the EXP for them). The game keeps track of how many pins you master, so it's a neat way to get you to beat the game to the fullest.

After you beat the game, you can replay any day of the 3 weeks, which is neat so you can play the game like you're new at it (except you'll be overpowered most likely, lol). Even after fighting the final boss you still have to unlock anything you missed in your Noise log and whatnot, and it just supplies you with even more hours of gameplay, and for only $20!

In the battles you control you and your partner, you with the stylus, and your partner with the directional pad (or the ABXY buttons if you're a lefty like I am). It sounds complicated, but trust me it's not. However you can choose to set your partner on autoplay so you don't have to worry about him or her.

All in all, this is a very unique RPG. If you have the $20 and are looking for several hours of gameplay/simple challenge, buy TWEWY. You won't regret it.","I have to say, this is easily one of my favorite RPGs of all time.",1313193600,,,

175033,5.0,True,"11 7, 2008",ARADXCOUVBS09,B001EB8CD6,Gavin Scott,"Wow.  I was expecting this to be a lot simpler than it turns out to be.  It's almost like a tiny pocket-sized version of Propellerhead's Reason software.  Obviously it's very limited by the DS hardware, but if you like messing around with music and music software then you can have hours of fun with this.

You get two monophonic synths with their own sequencer tracks for note/gate/pan/volume, plus a couple more tracks that can be assigned to modulate a long list of parameters and settings.  The synths are simple but have most of the things you need to replicate classic analog synth patches, and there are a few relatively novel routing options and modulation sources.  Synth patches can be saved and loaded separately from whole compositions.

You also get four ""drum"" voices which turn out to be four more instances of the same basic synth, though with a few less options and much simpler pattern programming.  So in total you get as many as six sounds happening at once, plus a very basic global effects section.  The drum sounds each get their own FX though.

A complete song is made of up to 100 strung together instances of 16 different ""patterns"".  Each pattern encompasses up to 16 beats/notes plus the programming for each synth and all its sequencer data.  So each pattern can sound and act completely different.

All the programming and composing is pretty much done at the pattern level.

Just about any knob or setting can be twiddled in real-time during playback, and you can interact with it through a two-octave on-screen keyboard or an X/Y ""KAOSS"" pad in addition to editing events directly in the sequencer view. You can also play the 16 patterns back manually so there quite a few performance opportunities.

The manual is of course very limited and someone could write a book about programming and making music on this thing.  It strikes me as a product where the developers had way more fun than their bosses thought they should have.  There are lots of well thought out details and some things that the manual can't even begin to discuss in enough depth.

It's not really a ""game"" of course so much as it's like buying a 1995 vintage synthesizer workstation that came with documentation in Japanese.  You need to be inclined towards this sort of thing in order to have fun with it, but it has much more depth than many pocket sized synthesizers and sound modules of the past.

Anyhow, if you have any interest in classic synthesizer hardware or music software, you'll probably love this.  Probably not a good gift though for a child who isn't already motivated in that direction.  One of the better ""adult level"" titles for the DS though.",Much more than I expected.,1226016000,56,,

I have since supplemented my 2600 with an Atari 7800 which also plays the same 2600 games. The Atari 2600 will always have a special place in my heart.

If you have a 2600, look for an accessory called the Arcadia/Starpath Supercharger. It plugged into the cartridge slot and loaded Supercharger games from an ordinary cassette player. One of the best games for the Supercharger was their version of Frogger, whose graphics and sound rivaled the graphics and sounds of the Atari 5200 and the Atari 400/800.

Despite the recent intervention of X-box and before that with Playstation, Nintendo has risen to the challenge presented by Sony and Microsoft to prove that not everyone is interested in bigger, better, faster and uglier. Nintendo has formed a franchise, much the same way Disney has and is now part of our cultural language. The characters we know the stories we love and the game, though basic in design appeal to us because there's a history and quality there. The Nintendo Game Cube, the most recent addition to the Nintendo family of consoles, will amaze you. The Nintendo simply does more with less than the other two systems. If you're struggling to decide how to spend your hard earned money just rent the systems or go over to a friends how and see the difference between them. The conclusion I came to was that the Nintendo offers more for less. You'll be able to afford more games and have more fun with the games that are offered. If you're struggling with the fact that the Playstation plays DVDs, know this, it is not by any means a good DVD player, meaning it doesn't relay the quality nearly as well as other DVD players.

The graphics are as with the newer games (On windows 7 64bit) very clear and crisp, and some of the objects are quite well hidden. I forget to add that all MPI games come with sound. None irritating ""Mystery Music""!! Love the fun and intensity it adds to these games over the Silent ones or the annoying silly voices!
I really like the locations on this game too. I played this free for a while with 1 coin to see if I wanted to buy it and I was hooked! Best way to enjoy these games is to own them, and not need to buy coins to keep playing! It's still the usual hidden object game you expect, with hidden Keys and Crowns for extra bonus points!
This one has a few differences from some past ones. The first is that you can choose a relaxed mode! Another is that you can choose limited or unlimited hints in the option menu.
Something else that makes it more of a challenge is more items are listed as clues rather than the direct names of the objects.

It's quite simple, the folks over at Media Molecule (those responsible for Little Big Planet on the PS3) have created such a creative and color world intermixed with some great platforming gameplay and unique use of some of Vita's hardware features.

Let me assure you that in no way do the use of the rear touch pads or cameras feel like a ""gimmick"" in this game.  In fact, it's quite the opposite, as each of the unique features (touch pads, cameras, tilt, etc) help transform the world/levels as you explore.  Can't reach certain areas, well bounce  your fingers on the rear touchpad to catapult your character into the air.  See something cool?  Take out your camera (and the awesome array of filters and lenses) and take a snapshot, or if feeling bored, take a selfie!

Want to customize your character to look however you want?  No problem, you can do that too!  In fact, I created my very own ""Ryo Hazuki"" costume for my messenger to wear.  It's awesome.  What other game allows you to do that?  I can't think of any.

The level of customization, and the overall theme of just being creative and creating whatever you want is such a pleasure to play and experience.  I didn't want this game to end, and thankfully (I've completed the story once so far) I can go back and relive each level collecting more items and snapping more pictures to expand the world even more.  I waited over a year for this game upon first hearing about it, and I'm happy to say it was well worth the wait.  So much in fact, this game might actually challenge Bioshock or Puppeteer for my personal GOTY.

It starts out as a marine who got back from the korean war or WWII pacific, and he joins the LA police departmnet. You gain levels and different types of missions as you solve cases and build a reputation for yourself throughout the game. You will solve anything from homocides, to fires, to getting street calls over the radio that you should if you choose to respond to them. Youll go from working as a street cop, to a high level detective. Though you will soon learn a lot about the character from flashbacks he had during the war, and from people he knew from the war.
THis game is extremely addicting for those gamers that enjoy puzzles and slow paced action filled with things you must solve, its pretty similar to the CSI games except you get to use a gun, and its in like the 50's. I would recommend this game to any person who likes a game that lasts a while and that you enjoy solving or finishing puzzles. The only downside for me is that driving is a pain in the ass because the distances can be really far from each other, which is good I guess because the world is large and you can explore a lot, however this can get monotonous, and coupled with that and the fact that dispatch will constantly berate you to go to a street crime, it can irritate you if you just want to get to your destination and start searching crime scenes.

The OLED display is gorgeous and eye popping. The graphics on some of the Vita's most impressive games are, in my opinion, on the same level as some PS3 games. The ability to have your game suspend in the background on the system while you check something on the internet or visit the PS Store works perfectly and quickly - this also works extremely well for playing on the go or in short bursts, especially with games that don't have instant save options. Overall, the operating system is fast and reliable, the layout is convenient and easy to use, the shape and feel in your hand is good, and the battery life is fairly decent for playing the quality of games that it supports.

Current games I would recommend when and if considering purchasing the Vita include: Killzone: Mercenary, Borderlands 2, Persona 4: Golden, Persona 3 Portable, Gravity Rush, Thomas Was Alone, Limbo, Guacamelee!, Lone Survivor, and Frobisher Says.

Upcoming games worth considering: Hyper Light Drifter, Hohokum, The Swapper, Citizens of Earth, Collectems, and Drifter.

Additionally:

The Playstation Store is easily accessible via Wifi and holds a vast library of PS Vita, PSP, PS One, and PS Mini games for viewing and purchasing.

*On a side note, there have been many complaints that the Vita's game library is lacking and that it's outlook looks a bit bleak. In staying current with Sony's response to this, they have noted that the continued support of AAA games for the PS Vita will be noticeably lacking in the future. However, it is important to note that the Vita will be receiving continued support through Indie game publishers (many of which actually turn out to be perfect for gaming on the go and feel right at home with the Vita). Furthermore, the backlog as mentioned is huge for this system and there is many gems to be found and enjoyed.

I wasn't a kid anymore, and I wasn't interested in playing some kind of Disney action adventure game.  Then I heard that there were cameos from some of my favorite Final Fantasy characters.  Disney and Final Fantasy?  Together?  That could never work...right?  Ah, but it does.  And that's not even the best part.  Sure you get to travel to Disney worlds and become good friends with Donald and Goofy.  Sure you get to run into some great Final Fantasy characters.  But the real strength of this game (and its sequels) is the original story and characters.  Sora is one of the best video game heroes to come along.  He's the consummate pure-hearted boy who has been chosen by destiny to save the world.  Like Frodo or Luke Skywalker.  And it totally works.

The story is simple, but excellent.  Our boy hero learns that his island home is only one of many worlds.  A dark force swallows his world and he finds himself in a mysterious town called Traverse Town.  There he meets new friends and learns about his destiny.  The Heartless, terrible beings of pure darkness are stealing peoples' hearts.  Worse, entire worlds are being lost to them.  The stars are going out one by one, and there is only one person who might be able to stop it.  Sora has been chosen to wield the Keyblade, the only weapon that can defeat the Heartless and protect the worlds from them forever.  Accompanied by Disney's Donald the Duck, and Goofy the...whatever Goofy is, Sora journeys to all sorts of Disney worlds, and a few original ones as well searching for his lost friends and the missing King Mickey.  From the sands of Agrabbah, to the haunted Halloween town, every world is a fun adventure.  Our heroes' journey will take them through Wonderland, Agrabbah, Halloween Town, Atlantis...all the way to the End of the World and the very heart of all worlds, Kingdom Hearts!

The characters are the heart of any story, and at its heart, ""Kingdom Hearts"" is the story of two friends (Sora and his best friend, Riku) who are on very different paths.  The tension and emotion invested in the original characters is the soul of this game, and what you will probably remember about it long after you are done playing.  And on top of all that, you get some great bad guys.  Of course there are the wonderful Disney villains like Captain Hook and the witch Maleficent, but the mysterious puppetmaster behind them all is one wicked bad guy.  Again there is an elegance to the simplicity of the villain.  He's just a guy who gave the universe a serious look and decided to choose the darkness rather than light.  (The game's sequels and prequel flesh out this character's past, but thankfully he never loses any of his simple dark wickedness.  The relationship between the characters leads up to one of my favorite video game endings ever.

If you've never picked up a Kingdom Hearts game, this is the place to start.  Don't be put off by the Disney characters and settings.  Here they work.  And the story is one not to be missed: a tale of the choice between darkness and light, the strength of heart it takes the choose the right one, and the friends you make along the way.","""Kingdom Hearts is light!""",1302912000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Coming just in time for the release of Metal Gear Solid 4, the purpose of this is to let those who want to absorb the story of the saga do so to refresh their minds for the concluding events of Metal Gear Solid 4.

The Metal Gear Solid saga centers primarily on an operative named Solid Snake.  The first game chronicles his mission through Shadow Moses Island where he has to stop his former unit Fox-Hound from launching a Nuclear Weapon: Metal Gear.  As he undergoes the mission, he discovers many revelations about himself and what the meaning of his very life could be.

Metal Gear Solid 2 picks up the story two years later in which Snake and friend Otacon form a non-profit organization known as Philanthropy.  They're mission is to get photographic evidence that the military is developing a new type of Metal Gear.  Unfortunately the Tanker Mission doesn't go as planned.  Two years later, a Plant is built where the Tanker went down and players were treated to one of Metal Gear Solid 2's most controversial plot twists, they discovered they would not be playing the rest of the game as Solid Snake and they'd be playing as an operative named Raiden.  Like Snake, Raiden's mission unravels many revelations about him.  The second installment, in particular, showers some of the best plot twists in the series.

Metal Gear Solid 3, on the other hand, takes the series back to the very beginning where you control an operative named Naked Snake, who will eventually go on to be known through the series as Big Boss.  During his mission he is sent to save an Operative named Sokolov before Colonial Volgin can get to him.  Much like Metal Gear Solid 2, the game is divided into two parts, and the first part is a failure only for the second part to be one of redemption.

The Metal Gear Solid franchise is famous for its storyline of Solid Snake and other characters.  The essential collection gives anyone a chance to relive the story with each episode back to back to back.  Every story is told through amazing cutscenes with great voice acting.  While some of the story sequences can get a little long (especially in Metal Gear Solid 2) they're filled with great direction and a lot of story to absorb.  And you'll want to absorb as much as you can, because Metal Gear Solid 4 will reference all three games.

The gameplay has also been very memorable, evolving throughout the series.  Along those lines, each game never makes you go about each situation the same way.  There are numerous ways to approach each situation, and with several difficulty levels (coupled with a few other extras in the second and third games) each game demands replay.  Even better is that for Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3 we got the Substance and Subsistence variants respectively.

If there was anything wrong with this collection, it would be that Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence doesn't include the second disc.  While it's true, Metal Gear Online is taken down for Subsistence, the second disc did include the original Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake.  These are two games that can really help add to the Metal Gear saga.  It's a small price, but for those who didn't own the original Subsistence and wanted to play the original two games, just know you won't get them with this collection.  However, this probably won't be seen as a big loss anyway.  The story of Metal Gear Solid can be well understood without the two original games.

If you don't own the Metal Gear Solid games and you'd like to know the story, this is a good investment.  The fact that you'll get Substance and Subsistence rather than just the original Sons of Liberty and Snake Eater make this a very good deal indeed.",Three Great Games for One Great Price,1214784000,,,

Story: Its pretty interesting knowing how Nep Nep met Plutia. I won't spoil the game but its very good. Of course i skipped the fanservice parts and focused on main story.

Gameplay: Same as the past few games. Turn based with some wierd changes to EXE DRIVE usage etc.

Graphics: Superb with some framerate lag but overall it runs well. I never had an issue.

Hours: I totaled to 40+ hours. There is so much to do in this game its insane!

NEW GAME+: After first runthrough, its better and easier to do end game content. I finished the game at lvl 68. End game content requires a mission all the way up to lvl 900! Got a long way to go!",A good game!,1512345600,,,

With tons more tracks, cars and options this time around, it has the makings of being a virtual racers' dream, but can GT2 live up to the original?
Highly anticipated, eagerly awaited sequels to million selling blockbusters usually have a knack for disappointing, but with Gran Turismo 2, the PlayStation's premier racing sim only gets bigger and better. For drivers who loved the challenge of the first, but who long for more cars and courses, your prayers have been answered with over 500 cars, and auto makers like Volkswagen, Audi and Mercedes-Benz joining the mix, as well as classic cars from the 60s and 70s. A Rally Mode has also been added for more replayability and different racing strategy, as well as a game status screen that gives you the lowdown on all of your racing accomplishments. Even with these new extras, GT2 is still solid as a rock. Each new car has been added with the same painstaking detail as the original, and the new tracks (as well as some old favorites) also hold up pretty well. There have been some minor changes in gameplay, like the addition of tire and car damage occurring during the race (and massively affecting your handling), and horsepower limitations have been placed on most races, placing more of an emphasis on handling rather than on power alone. All in all, GT2 does a remarkable job of staying true to the original, without seeming old or tiresome. The glorious graphical detail of the first GT has been tarnished slightly with noticeable seam breaking and pop-up, which have to be a product of disc limitations (even though GT2 is a two-disc set) and the PSX showing its age. But the car models are still top notch, the sense of speed remains accurate, and the replays are still a joy to watch. The minor graphical complaints would probably not be so distracting if we weren't living in the age of Dreamcast. Sound in GT2 is again top notch. The cars sound real, down to minute changes in tone after you make high-powered modifications. The game includes a great modern rock soundtrack from the likes of Garbage, Stone Temple Pilots, Foo Fighters and Filter. These tunes will keep you from popping in your own CDs to cover up the usual videogame racing fare. The GT series will always be remembered for its control. Not only while racing, but also for the unlimited tinkering one can do on their car. More modifications have been added this time around, but the feel of driving remains the same. Newcomers may find it difficult to compensate for the differences between front, rear or four-wheel drive, but for old GT pros it will come back as second nature. Even though Gran Turismo 2 shows its age (and its system's age) and Rally Mode doesn't live up to the rest of the game, GT2 is still as close as you can get to the real thing and always worth the drive.",Can't get better than this,1057622400,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Con:
the stats rating and % system is lacking in detail and explanation. i wish Blizzard could do a better job on that end.

369123,5.0,False,"03 14, 2017",A7PVPRYTJITDA,B00LCHZRIK,Wade Williams,"To be blunt, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is arguably the best Zelda game ever made and it's definitely the most ambitious. Nintendo has outdone themselves, you have to hand it to them. There is very little negative to say about this game. Let's do a break down of the pros and cons.

Pros:
+Best Zelda story to date. Yes, it may be the same premise, but there is much more depth this time around. There are other things going on, not just Link rescuing Zelda. All of the side quests add so much to the main story. The depth is what makes the game succeed.
+Voice acting adds a lot to some of the characters we already know and love, including Zelda herself. It makes for a richer and more interesting story.
+Gameplay is king in Zelda games. We all know this. BOTW is no different. There is a ton of gameplay variety, more than there has ever been. Everything from fighting, exploring, cooking, transportation, it's all been either improved or newly introduced.
+Open World and Exploration are front and center in BOTW. The open world design allows you take whatever path you choose. While most Zelda games in the past were linear, this is not the same. Whatever approach you prefer is completely fine. The freedom really shines through in BOTW.
+The beautiful art style makes up for anything lacking in the graphics department. The Wii U and Switch are not on par with the PS4 and Xbox One, so don't expect that type of beauty, but the art style truly does make a big difference. Nintendo has always been king when it comes to gorgeous art and design. Exploration is one of the game's biggest draws. Conquering the 100+ shrines is amazing!
+Wii U and Switch versions offer choice for the gamer. You don't have to upgrade to the Switch to experience BOTW. The Wii U version is every bit as great as the Switch one. In fact, I owned the Switch version but got rid of it in favor of the Wii U version. I did not see the point in upgrading since the only other Switch game I care about is Mario Odyssey and that doesn't come out for almost another year.
+More than 100 hours of gameplay offers major value (in your wallet) and replay value. There is always something to see and do!
+The game world is absolutely huge. This lends itself to many hours of fun, whether you are doing side quests, the main quests, shrines, or goofing off.
+Challenging and thought provoking puzzles are a standout in BOTW. Every shrine has a challenging puzzle, while most boss battles require you to solve a puzzle as well.
+Cooking is really fun. Doing recipes is a blast, just experimenting with food can be an interesting distraction.
+Great A.I., from the main characters, townsfolk and enemies.
+Use the Wii U Pro controller for the best experience. It is more tight and comfortable than the GamePad. I don't have experience with the Switch Pro Controller (probably because it's $70!) but I am sure it's superior to the Joy-Cons and Grip.

Cons:
-Weapons break a lot, maybe too much. I found that a lot of my time was devoted to changing weapons, whether in a battle or not. It's not a game-breaker but it is an annoyance.

Overall, Zelda BOTW is an all time great. It's a game you must experience and have in your collection. I bought the Wii U version, but the choice is yours.

This is one of the best FPS games I've ever played bar none.  The graphics, the atmosphere, the storyline.....EVERYTHING is in order.

Sure it's linear, but considering the story and the fact that you spend most of your time in a subterranean environment, that can be forgiven.  If you have a high end rig, this game will nearly rival Crysis 3 in it's beauty.  One area where it does exceed Crysis 3 though, is in the physics department.....or specifically, PhysX.

The PhysX implementation in Metro Last Light is perhaps the best of any game to date, including Batman Arkham City.  Getting into a fire fight with Advanced PhysX turned on and seeing all the debris, sparks, grenade flak, smoke etcetera is just incredible!

Pros:
-I really enjoyed the dark and creepy atmosphere. If you are playing this game at night, you'll probably be listening so carefully that you'll be able to hear your own heartbeats.
-The graphics and audio quality are terrific.
-The attention to detail coupled with the nostalgic soundtrack from the 1979 masterpiece really made me feel immersed in the game. If you are not a fan of the Alien series, you'll still enjoy this game, but you may not understand the subtle hints related to the movies.
-Please play this game on Easy or Normal. Playing on Hard mode will leave you super frustrated.
-The campaign is long: ~12hr.

Cons:
I try not to give games a 5 star rating, but I can't find many flaws with this game.
-There is no multiplayer option in this game. It seems like some kind of multiplayer survival mode would have been a welcomed addition, but it's not critical to enjoying the game. I can't dock points for every feature that isn't in the game.
-Some oddities with the items in the game. Example: Why do my flashlight batteries only last about 2 minutes? Would unlimited flashlight time really make the game too easy? Why can't I kill the alien with the in game guns? Vasquez killed one with a 9mm in the 1985 movie.

Note:

The Cherry MX Red switches have a great tactile feeling and are a vast improvement from the G910 which featured Romer G switches.  The difference being a longer key travel before it registers that a key has been pressed.  Now of course for my hardcore gaming friends you may argue that shorter key travel is better for gaming, and I would agree, but I personally have never bought a keyboard solely for its gaming functionality.

The G610 Orion Red, is a lower cost alternative to the G810 Orion Spectrum, though don't think that lower cost means less functionality.  Literally the only difference I find between the two is the lack of full RGB LEDs on the G610.  While the G610 does not have the multiple colors i the backlights it does have a white backlight that can be programed in one of five different patterns:  Lighting modes- Fixed, breathing, star effect, light wave, key press.

Pros:
 The feel of the Cherry MX Red Switches offers a great tactile feel with quick response.
 The gaming software allows you to set up gaming profiles, create macros(F1-F12), and view heat map of which keys you hit the most.
 Integrated audio controls, love the oversized volume wheel.
 Superb build quality

Cons:
 No included wrist rest

The only glaring omission I see with this offering from Logitech is the lack of any kind of wrist rest.  This is a great keyboard for the price.  It has all the features of the higher priced G810 Orion Spectrum for about $60 less.  So if you can live without the flash of full RGB lighting, then this is the keyboard for you.","Quality keyboard from a name you can trust, just wish it had a place to rest your wrists",1463702400,,,

439747,5.0,False,"10 28, 2016",A2NOJVQUPKPTEI,B01FWKKVTM,R. Pickman,"I received an email about this set from NiS in March (I think). I had never heard of the game(s) before. I looked at screenshots, saw that it came out around Halloween and was pretty intrigued. If you ordered direct from NiS you also got a lithograph and an insulated mug that's just the main character on a black background, but when you add hot liquid the background illuminates as if you turned on a flashlight. It's pretty cool and I was sold. Flash forward to last week, I received an email stating I had a shipment from NiS. I had completely forgot about ordering it, so it was a pleasant surprise that was delivered a day prior to release.

I've only gone through a large chunk of Yomawari: Night Alone. I'll expand on this review when I've completed both titles. I just need to talk about this game!

First of all, the Vita has experienced an even greater degree of developer ignorance than the PSP suffered. There are a myriad of PSN titles that would be perfect for the handheld, but most deem it an unprofitable endeavor (which is mostly justifiable). So, when an actual game (not visual novel) comes up, I generally try to pounce on it. Adventure titles get very little love these days also. I think it's a genre that's often overlooked as studios try to crank out flashier ""more exciting"" titles. Don't get me wrong, I love shooters, RPGs and action titles. But let's not underestimate adventure titles either.

Yomawari does virtually everything right. This is the adventure title I've been waiting for and apparently it's been hiding in Japan. You're a little girl who loses her dog as you're walking home at dusk. You return home and upon telling your sister that the dog has been lost, she sets out into the night to try and find him. You get scared when your sister doesn't return, so you embark on a journey through your town to find your sister and dog. You meet no other people throughout your journey - well - no living people at least. You wander through a deserted town and countryside, areas opening up as you find keys and items and progress the story. The world is creepy, beautiful and even confusing at times, but it all works together and hooks you along its story.

Gameplay is simple. You can move, turn your flashlight on and off, run for a limited period of time, tip-toe and hide in bushes. There are a handful of usable items. But mostly you're a defenseless young girl in a town full of ghosts and monsters, most of whom want you dead. I personally love adventure titles like this, where you are defenseless and can rely only on puzzle solving and strategy to accomplish your tasks.

There are a plethora of spirits in this world. Each type behave and react differently to various stimuli. Most cannot be seen unless light is shone directly on them (either via streetlamp, flashlight or other light source). Some will only attack if light is on them, others walk in a straight line and can only be seen with light, some respond only to running, others I haven't quite figured out yet. There are ""Boss"" spirits that are unique and serve to drive certain story elements. Engagements with them are mostly figuring out how they move, how to avoid them and what things trigger them to attack while you're racing to figure out where you need to go and what you need to do to stop/appease them.

Sound is great. It definitely goes with the visuals. There is typically no music playing which adds to the creepy factor.

Visually it's a beautiful game. The art is consistent and marries cute and creepy flawlessly. The lighting effects are great and they, coupled with the humming of electricity, create a wonderful atmosphere that's familiar to anyone who was allowed to stay out past when the streetlights came on.

Overall, I just can't say enough great things about the game. It's an adventure title on par with the classics that refuses to hold your hand and will have you scratching your head on more than a few occasions. If you have a Vita and are looking for something creepy for Halloween, dust it off and buy the game!

***Collector's Edition***
So, as I mentioned, I got a bonus by pre-ordering directly from NiS in the form of the lithograph and mug in addition to the contents of what Amazon has. The art books are VERY limited. As described; 10-14 pages each. It's neat to flip through. The soundtrack is cool, I like game soundtracks so it was a plus. The box is nice.",SO GOOD!,1477612800,,,

As is typical with Nintendo games it is a genre-bending title, a little bit FPS, a little Adventure, a little bit Puzzle, etc... It's truly a refreshing title.

Some have said that the graphics aren't that good.  I would challenge that.  If you have it on a HDTV using Component or even the S-Video connector, the graphics are in fact very, very good (as the game is in 480P, DVD quality).  Sure it's not 720P or 1080i/p, but it looks better to me than many original Xbox titles.

I will avoid all spoilers so don't worry here. The campaign is great, with the greatest voice acting and visuals ever. I don't think I have ever seen a game with as good of graphics as GOW3, utterly stunning. The voice actors are very convincing. And the small detail that the designers put into the visuals is amazing. There are many hidden ""Easter Eggs""(little secrets put into a game just for fun) that add to the replay value of the campaign, as well as co-op. Arcade mode also adds a competitive piece to campaign allowing you to fight for the most points over your teammates. We see the return of most of the characters, though a bit older looking now, and the new Carmine is better than ever. The story was written very well and we get to see some new enemies as well. Basically, the campaign is utterly amazing and great. Good job here EPIC.
Horde mode is also improved with the ability to purchase blockades, decoys, turrets, sentries and silver-backs. You earn money for kills, assists, and completing bonus objectives (usually killing enemies in different ways. EG: 10 Head-shots in a round). The more points you spend on specific ""fortifications"", the more you level it up. With higher levels you can build enhanced versions of that fortification, and unlock new ones. Also, a good job here.
Beast mode is an interesting mode that puts you in the shoes of the locust as they attack in horde. You get to fight through 12 waves of horde as locust. The more kills and assists that you get, the more locust breeds become unlocked. You start out with simple breeds like tickers and wretches, then unlock stronger breeds like boomers and berserkers (oh is it fun being a berserker).
And one last thing is the new abilities that you can do. Trading weapons with characters, both A.I. and player controlled, is a very nice addition. And if both characters have the same weapon, one can choose to share his ammo with the other.

Now for the little bad points. (Mostly all of these are in online matchmaking)
If you had the chance to play the beta of GOW3 you will see that a lot has changed, and not all for the good. It seems that there were many complainers who played the beta, and EPIC listened to them. The retro-lancer now spreads more quickly than it did in the beta, and it was already fairly in-accurate. You also slow down more when you get shot during a retro-charge or ""roadie-run"". The sawed off shotgun is also much less effective than it twas. The range of it has been reduced to a bare point-blank. Anymore and it won't even do damage. The gnasher shotgun is much farther range, and I feel that it's a little too far. The gnasher can now kill someone from 15+ yards pretty quickly. Besides these, most of the weapons have been left untouched power-wise. And, when playing campaign or horde, the weapons seem to be just as powerful as they were in the beta. It seems like they just changed it for match-making.
The other bad point that this has is the team balancing. The problem is, I don't think it exists. I have been on teams that have had 3 bots (A.I. players). And bots do not play very good, mostly they are just walking ammo banks they give the other team kills. Of course this is in a quick match, but even in a ranked match, it also does not seem to keep even ranks on the teams when playing. Plus ranked matches take much longer to get into and don't really rank you up any quicker.

All in all though, Gears of War 3 is a great game and I definitely recommend buying it. The campaign is perfect, the horde and beast modes are great, and you can get past the little annoyances, match-making is decent as well. So EPIC, you still get a nice 5 star, well done!",Mostly for the Best,1320019200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I've given Multiplayer another chance, and I've got to say I've been really hooked the last 2-3 days. It isn't Quake or UT or COD or Titanfall. It borrows from these. But I've been having a blast with it.

Like Quake it is an arena shooter. Like COD it is designed to be game pad friendly, which I don't think is a bad thing. I think the most confusing thing about it is that it uses many of the same weapons from DOOM's campaign and so you will expect them to be familiar but they are different. I have found that the Combat Shotgun is the most useful weapon and you don't unlock that until Level 12 I think. For me unlocking it was a complete game changer, and now I can finally enjoy and appreciate the game. Due to the map design, it really doesn't matter that much whether I play with KB & Mouse or Gamepad. I perform similarly regardless. Which I kinda like. Having grown to really like this game, now I would say that the biggest problems with it are that TDM is the only game mode people play.

---Original Review---

I bought this via Steam and not Amazon, but I want to make sure to give this game positive reviews every avenue that I can bc I really hope to see more like this.

The singleplayer is amazing. I did not care for the multiplayer. I really hope that Bethesda/ID continue to expand the Doom franchise as a single player experience, and I really hope to see them take what they have learned and reboot the Quake franchise as a multiplayer experience.

Also ignore the 1 star reviews none are verified purchases and are just hating.

I picked this game up in person and i was into it from the 1st 5 sec, usually im always trying to get controls and getting use to the feel but i easily got into this. Menus are easy to use and it's not just heres your car and go race, there's a ton of options you choose and a good variety of cars/tracks. Youtube doesnt really do justice to graphics but it looks amazing on my samsung tv and the physics/handling/sound (the audio is 10/10) is just perfect. Im not that deep into it yet but i know my 60$ have been worth it so far, ignore the hate and get this game if you're a racing fan.

edit:
theres a issue on psn or something and i will full review later on but one minor thing i did dislike is the best 10 cars are unlocked by being a ""club level"" i mean it's in the title but the other cars are 'driver level"" im assuming solo. So yeah youll have to play online to unlock and not just unlocked solo

second edit: ... there seems to be BIG problems and this is so embarassing. Both 2k15 and driveclubs launch have been plagued with server and psn being slow/lagging is not helping whatsoever, im gonna just wait until a patch comes out in a few weeks that adds weather and fixes all these issues. It's not super unplayable but why release a game if everything isn't 100% i don't get it. Great game when working i guess.

final edit:

Okay.. all the people giving bad reviews about the online are all right, it's been a disaster. For a game to get delayed this much and then this happens while forza was announced in less time and came out in lesser time and every1 is on it while we're still waiting. Online is still off and on as i write this review 11 days after launch. I'll just list the good and bad things

+ The locations of this game are beautiful eye candy and all are designed in a top notch way it's just great graphics.
+ great car selection (people always talk about how other games like GT have more but i honestly don't care) like i'd rather less cars more polished and detailed then have 2000 cars. Devolpers can focus more on quality over quantity, i mean in a 2000 car game how many are you going to drive like seriously?
+ day and night cycle (weather will come later on)
+ good leveling system. (i thought club level was a bad thing before but nvm that.) you're gonna have to earn the good cars and some of the races are really hard (frustrating hard.. a few)
+ i love how the cars drive/handle like they all have a differ feel to em,
+ great audio very realistic

- 30fps.. a racing game should be 60 fps i don't mind compromising reosolution or graphics a little for it
- some races are just HARD
- the broken online launch (for a game thats online driven)
- not a whole lot of customization
- you lose points if a.i crashes into you.. like yeah it's my fault hes not driving by me but driving into me

There's more pros and cons.. but you get the point. I like the game as i stated before. Online may be broken now but later on hopefully it'll be fine and ill be having a blast, i just wish they probably delayed it like a week or 2 to fix online.. but oh well. Oh and closed circuit isn't for everyone so if open world is more of your thing or complete sim is more of your thing then get project cars for sim or forza for open world.

-Before I Begin...
My review will be spilt up into sections and have a in-depth look at that topic. If you hate reading medium/long reviews or just don't have the patience I would not continue reading, but if you want to learn the most about the product before you buy it you'll continue.

-Interface
The interface is just the same as Ransom Of The Seven Ships and the other newer games. Just point in the direction you want to go in and click basically. There is a new icon though that is special to this game, that is the Phone icon. The Phone icon lets you go onto Nancy's phone to make calls, take pictures, get text messages, change the time in the game, and change the settings (background and message tone). I really liked the cell phone feature of this game because it has been missing from the games for a while (last seen in Legend Of The Crystal Skull and it only let you call people). It's a lot of fun to take pictures and change the background of the phone too.
*****

-Plot
The plot surrounds the ""Black Cat"", a person who is sending threatening notes to valedictorian candidates and even causing them to leave the school by way of ""freakish accidents"". The most recent victims were either sent to the hospital because of an allergic reaction or locked up in a closet in the dead of night. I loved this plot because it was somewhat scary and it even tied in with some history of Waverly Academy and a real-life famous poet. I found the plot pretty straightforward yet very intriguing because there is a couple plot twists that add even more oomph. I really liked that there was basically one mission: find out who the ""Black Cat"" is! I just loved this plot a lot!
*****

-Characters
If you played Ransom Of The Seven Ships, you may have been extremely disappointed with the amount of characters/suspects there was. Well if you were disappointed then, you won't be with this game! There are five characters in this game, each with very different personalities. There is a goth girl, a straight-A outcast/nerd, a shy girl, a sporty determined girl, and the conceited gossip girl. You'll definitely have fun meeting all of them and hearing what they have to say about each other. I loved that there were so many characters! There was also a couple minor characters that you don't ""see"" that were cool too. Warnings At Waverly Academy basically makes up for all the lack of characters in Ransom Of The Seven Ships. There was a lot of interaction with the characters too, so it wasn't just like having one conversation in the beginning of the game and then not having anything else to say to them at all. I really enjoyed the characters and it has definitely been a step up from the character interaction from previous games like Haunting Of Castle Malloy or Legend Of The Crystal Skull.
*****

-Setting & Graphics
The graphics never seem to be a problem with the Nancy Drew games. And this game is no exception because the graphics are absolutely breathtaking. I loved the fact that the dorm was in an old mansion-like hall. There is a lot of places to go in the game. There is a library, rec room, and a whole bunch of dorm rooms to explore. Also there are some outdoor places like the big oak tree and the cellar. One thing I didn't like is that the setting was confined to just one building and sparse outdoor settings. I understand the game would need more memory to have more buildings but I would have liked to maybe go to a couple more classrooms (there is one in Ramsey Hall). Also the dorm rooms were really cool but there is not very many ""angles"" per say. I would have liked to do a 360 pan in each of the dorm rooms. Otherwise I really liked the way they designed Ramsey Hall and it is really pretty outside when it snows in the game (yes it does snow in the game!). You won't necessarily feel confined, but I did wish the game had at least one other building.

-Puzzles/Activities
Ransom Of The Seven Ships was definitely a game for those who love puzzles, this game is more revolved around the plot. The puzzles in this game were pretty moderate, none were as challenging as Ransom Of The Seven Ships. There was plenty of variety though which I enjoyed. You also got to do some fun stuff too like play air hockey, darts, and run the snack shop for merits. Speaking of merits, you could also get plenty of demerits. You can get caught being up after curfew, pulling the fire alarm, sneaking into people's rooms, climbing trees and etc. It's really fun to get demerits, but if you get 15 or more you get expelled. Another thing I liked was the use of Nancy's cell phone. A couple activities required you to go around and take pictures of things/people for the school website and you also get text messages concerning gossip. I found myself constantly wanting to run the snack shop because while you are working, some of the girls start chattering and their conversations are quite funny. Overall, you will have a lot of fun completing the puzzles and activities in the game even if they are not particularly challenging.
*****

-Ending
One disappointment of this game was the ending! I really didn't want the game to end because I was having so much fun! The problem with the ending is that it came kind of unexpectedly. The ending puzzles were pretty suspenseful though which was a great. Also the wrap-up/motive was really interesting and made sense. Although I didn't like that the ending came unexpectedly/abruptly, I did enjoy it and found the resolution to tie the game up nicely.
****

-Overall
I know that many people were disappointed with Ransom Of The Seven Ships, but this game kind of balances out Ransom. Warnings At Waverly Academy is solely surrounded by the plot and its characters while Ransom is more centered on its puzzles and setting. So if you had to pick only one to buy, I would base it on whether you are a puzzle junkie or like interacting with characters more. I really enjoyed this game just as much as I enjoyed Ransom. I just liked that they are totally different from each other so playing both of them makes me happy. Warnings has been a step up in a lot of areas like character interaction, plot and scariness. This game wasn't extremely scary, but it did have me curious and engaged. If you played this game on Halloween night you wouldn't be too scared at all (I would recommend Curse Of Blackmoor Manor, Legend Of The Crystal Skull or Ghost Dogs Of Moon Lake if you want scary). This game was definitely one of my top favorites, maybe even my number one because I just loved the setting and characters. I fully recommend this game to all mystery fans (although it may appeal more to girls because it takes place at an all girls boarding school) because it is a great mystery adventure game. It is definitely worth the $20! The next case will come out summer of 2010, Nancy Drew 22: Trail Of The Twister!

I expected to play this game for atleast two months. When I started playing I just could not stop. To be honest I'm kind of glad I'm done I was spending way to much time with it lol. Now I can go back to playing the games I normaly play, fighting from SSFIV to King of Fighers 98 UM I am a fighting game fanatic! Anyway enough with that on to what I thought of the game.

This game manage to do something GTA 4 did not do hold my attention.  You knew that comparison was comming. Even though this game is known for its over the top nature the story missions are anything that you would see in a GTA series. Escort somebody here, protect this, go in a building a shoot everyone up you get the picture. The story presented itself in a pretty realistic way. The game goes crazy with the side missions. I don't want to get into them but the fight club, fuzz, drug trafficing and property damage was some of my favorites. If you never played a side mission and stuck to the maing story you would see this game a s being fairly serious. Being able to customise your character was fun. I liked being able to make a sexy woman causing all this mayhem. Usualy its a guy you see doing this stuff. Making a female character was a nice change of pace. The one major downside was how many times this game crashed on me. This game would crashed just about everytime I played it in the begining. That is completly unexceptable. I can deal with some glitches, like the one where my car got stuck in the road for no reason and I could not drive. But, the game just crashing no thats pathetic. The timing of the crashes was the worst. I had a tendency to crash after I beat a mission, right before the game would load back up it would freeze. Turn system off, redo the the mission over, that sucked.

Despite the flaws off the game it is really fun. For me atleast it managed not to get stale. It is not a five star game, but I enjoyed it so much I game it that high a score. Gta 4 managed to take itself way to serious and managed at times to be stale instead of fun. It got boring so I just quit playing. This game I could not put down.

One minor word of caution to anyone out there that uses Hombrew on their Wii. This model does communicate with the Wii differently, so software that was compiled many years ago may not recognize this model remote. Many older Homebrew applications have been abandoned by their creators, so older emulators may not support these remotes while others with proper support have been updated. SNES9X-GX and FCEUGX are two such emulators that DO have support while HUGO-GX on the other hand has been abandoned and will NOT work with these motion+ models.

Master Ninja wasn't too insane but then that unlocks Ultimate Ninja (which is a new category for the series), and I'll tell you what, it will test every ounce of your patience (the White Spider bosses of Day 7 are absolutely bonkers difficult).

162940,5.0,False,"02 15, 2009",AXZDMN4P056YB,B0017HPE6K,Jonaskin,"I'm an old school fan of Sonic the Hedgehog. I grew up playing his games on the Sega Master System and Megadrive, and always preferred him to Mario. Sonic 3 is, and always will be my favourite game of all time. When I first saw Sonic Adventure for the Dreamcast, I was absolutely blown away. But then Sonic Adventure 2 was a bit of a let down (for me personally, I know a lot of people consider it the best of the 3D Sonic titles), and the Sonic games since have truly defined mixed bag - some great ones on Handhelds (the Advance and Rush series), and console titles ranging from mediocre to awful (for my money, the low point of the series was Sonic Heroes. I even preferred 06 to that piece of rubbish). I've tended to stay away from a lot of the spin offs (haven't even touched Secret Rings or any of the Riders sub series), but I usually get some enjoyment out of even the mediocre Sonic games such as Shadow and 06.

Sonic Unleashed however, isn't one of those mediocre Sonic games - in fact, I can honestly say this is the best Sonic has been since the days of 16 bit. I had high hopes for this game, was a little wary about the whole Werehog concept, but on the whole, Sonic Team really nailed it with this one.

First of all, they got the mix of speed and platforming spot on. The daytime stages are very much reminiscent of the original games, with multiple paths through the levels, and an exhilarating sense of speed.

Second, the graphics for the PS3 version are stunning. Bright, colourful and highly detailed, with a great blend of classic Sonic style with real-world elements. And the music ranks up there with the best - no cringe worthy themes, just awesome, lively music that captures the feel of each environment perfectly. The Spagonia day music is truly memorable and is right up there with Icecap Zone from Sonic 3 as some of the greatest in Sonic's history.

Third - The story is just right. It doesn't become too intrusive, but sets things up nicely, and is helped along with some great CG clips and competent voice acting. Nothing too melodramatic like in Shadow or 06, just light and cheerful. Probably the best part is there are very few annoying side characters. I actually think Chip is one of the best characters to come along in the series, his voice acting is done well, and he adds a nice touch of humour. Tails and Amy have small supporting roles, and there's no useless, lame supporting characters like Rouge the Bat, Big the Cat and E123 Omega, some of the worst offenders from previous entries.

The daytime levels are wonderful, but even the much criticised Werehog levels aren't bad. I can definitely see where the comparisons to God of War come from, no it's not as good as GoW (and to be honest what could be?) but it's far from a deal breaker. In fact, they're still fun.

The little hub world quests are a nice distraction, and there's plenty of hidden content to discover and unlock, as well as trophies to earn. One minor annoyance is having to find so many Sun/Moon medals to unlock extra stages, but this adds to the longevity of the game and it's really a minor nitpick.

Overall, I highly recommend Sonic Unleashed. You can tell the new Sonic Team that made it respected the roots of Sonic and it shows. If you loved the old Sonic games, chances are you'll love this. Ignore the bad reviews from the gaming press, and you'll enjoy the best Sonic has been in 10 years.",Don't believe the bad press...this is the best Sonic game in a decade,1234656000,8,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

At first I was surprised at the lower than standard price of the game, but my hunch that this will be an awesome addition to the series was right. The game is truly one of the best games on the 3DS to date, even though the reviewers on major sites have not given this game much attention. Metacritic shows that Nno Assault does have 75 out of 100 score from eight professional critics and 8.5 out of 10 from eight users. But I think it deserves more.

I am very happy with Nano Assault for a number of reasons. First of all since the release of Nintendo 3DS not every title has the best 3D effect. Some games show it with too little depth, others have it but use it in environments where it may look misplaced. As you may have seen from the screen shots, in this game, you control a small, microscopic ship. This ship is traveling inside various organic tissue or microscopic world where everything that we cannot see without the aid of the microscope resembles an object floating in a liquid, like an asteroid in space. The 3D somehow works really well in this environment. Some levels allow onto see the entire level, which is a solid object, entirely on the screen and 3D effect looks amazing.

Second is the gameplay am graphics. You move your ship around the surface of an object, such as an organic cell, or an ameba and shoot various enemies that are supposed to be a result of an infection. Without spoiling the little plot that there is, the enemies consist of bugs, worms, viruses, or micro nano robots not unlike your ship. You move around the surface of the object shooting large quantities of enemies and dodging their attacks. Introductory leels are easy, but pretty quick it becomes rather difficult which is a good thing, not always found in a game. There are power ups and natural obstacles you may have to avoid, and pretty awesome grotesque bosses. Levels look beautifully designed with diversity of color and particle effects. The concep may e familiar if you have played Robotron 2084 or the more recent Geometry Wars.

Anyway, highly recommend Nano Assault to everyone, but especially to arcade style twitch schmup fans.","One of The Best 3DS Titles, If Somewhat Overlooked By Review Sites",1333152000,,,

Gameplay 10/10
Alright the gameplay is quite strange for Megaman so listin up you switch between Lan (a human kid in the real world) and Megaman EXE (Megaman's newest form a netnavi who goes through cyber space kicking (...)) now in the real world you as Lan go through a normal life in his futuristic world where everything is run by computers but this means viruses are much more in number and can be deadly so it's up to Lan to take Megaman to the electronic device that needs viruses cleared out of it or hostile netnavis as Megaman you use battle chips (microchips that give him weapons and abilities) you can get these through a turn based system a meter fills up and when it does you pick which chip out of five that you randomly pulled (kinda like your hand in a card game) but you are not limited to pulling just one chip per turn you can also make combos by pulling more than one of the same kind of chip of by pulling two chips of the same code. A code is put on the bottom of each chip two chips that have a H code can be played in the same turn even if they aren't the same kind of chip and chips that are the same can be played together even if they are not of identical code by the way new chips (which there are 175) can be obtain from detroying viruses for example if you detroy a dash virus you may get his chip depending on what kind of busting level you get busting level is a rank system which goes from 1-10 and S and you have a better chance of getting a chip if you get a 10 rank rather than a 5 now after you have selected your chips you can fight the viruses in a 3D battle arena which is split up into 18 panels 9 blue panels and 9 red panels you stand on the blue and cannot cross on to the red and and the same applies for you foes on the red you move about dogding attacks while launching your own its strange for Megaman but it works very well aside from battling in cyberspace you will also explore and solve puzzles many of which require you to be both Lan and Megaman to solve them example in cyberspace there is alocked door but it has a passnumber it is based on how many chairs are in Lans classroom in the real world therefore you must become Lan to solve the puzzle. A way this is a rpg is that Megaman can level up but not through exp points he levels up by finding upgrade items such as HPmemories which raises your overall HP (you start with 100) and Powerups which raise your power rapid and charge up powers of your buster these upgrades can be found in various areas of cyberspace or the real world or by buying them from merchants speaking of exploring that is another great thing about this game you can explore areas of cyberspace in just about anything electronic such as vending machines, game systems, tvs, and the most expansive area the internet but you can still explore the real world and interact with the people in the various towns particapate in netbattles where Megaman fights their netnavi and trade battle chips noy to mention while exploring you can try to get all the battle chips in the game. Also old fans will reconize old bosses reborn in this game such as Bombman Iceman Elecman and Protoman.
Story 10/10

I have whole mess of computers because my friend works in a Cyberpower inc, and I tried it on one of the most cheap computers that I had. It was only AMD Athlon 2000+, 512mb ram, GeForce 4 MX 440 64mb, with DSL and I was able to run it with no bugs, no lags, and on medium settings. But you guys who whines that this game is filled with bugs, try to see if your system meets the requirments. If it does, then try to see if there is anything else wrong with your PC. But if the game is still not working or has bugs, try downloading a patch or return it. You guys don't have to make bad comments and rate it bad just because it doesn't run on your PC and it does on mine. If you didn't play the game itself you shouldn't rate it.
Now back to the game itself, this game is amazing. I have played it and enjoyed every minute playing this game. It's so much better than Battlefield 1942 because you have newer weapons, more maps, and different vehicles. Not only that, you will have more wide variety of tactics such as the Vietcong's Hit and Run or set up a trap with logs. It definitly has better sounds with radios in vehicles and better graphics. And no, it doesn't have worse graphics then Battlefield 1942. Oh crap, I have to go. Just make sure you have better computer than Pentium 3 1.4 or Athlon XP 1600+ with 512mb ram, GeForce 4 TI and Radeon 9000 or higher with DSL or higher connection to play without so much lags. The reason why the graphics reccomendation is so high is because this will make a big diffrence in the game. If you only have a GeForce 2, 3, Radeon 8500 or lower, it might not run very fast. To play it on highest settings with no lags, get at least Athlon XP 3200+, 1GB ram, Radeon 9600XT or GeForce 5700 Ultra with cable modem.

Games made by Nintendo have a very strong sense of nostalgia that really appeals to me, since I've been playing video games since the Atari 2600 days.  Nintendo has been working with these characters (Mario, the Princess, Bowser) for 20 years now, and each new game manages to reference all the other games in clever ways.

For example, in Paper Mario, much of the music is from older games -- not just the famous Mario theme, but a lot of other, more obscure stuff, too.  The dialogue constantly parodies older games.  When we first meet Bowser in this game, he climbs in his clown-faced ship and zooms toward the screen, then away into the distance, just like he did in Super Mario World (SNES), back when scaling and rotation were amazing new tricks.

But the nostalgia is just a small part of the fun here.  Paper Mario features turn-based battles, where you must strategize in using different items and attacks and defending yourself against enemies.  I've played only two other games of this style -- Super Mario RPG and Chrono Trigger -- but I'm told those are two of the best example.  Paper Mario equals if not tops the great battles of those games.

The gameplay outside of battle is innovative, with lots of challenges to figure out -- but none so hard that you'll ever be stuck for long.  I really liked how you play as different characters at different times (including Bowser and the Princess), and the romantic subplot between the Princess and a HAL-like computer is hilarious.  You even get to ""dance"" with a computer-generated Princess clone (and take a shower afterwards if you like).

There's a lot of innovative touches in the graphics, too.  I love how the walls of houses collapse when you step through the door, allowing you to see inside.  The spiraling stairs of the first castle look amazing, and I like how, at times, pipes will take Mario into the distant background of a level.  I'm surprised there's no slowdown in some scenes, such as when you're mobbed by hundreds of Skeleton Koopas, or are being followed by 101 Punies (the giant tree level is the most clever level in any recent game I can think of).

Some might complain that the graphics are too ""cartoony,"" but to me, they're perfect.  If I want ""realistic"" graphics, I'll watch TV or see a movie.  Games that create new worlds and new ideas my eyes have never seen before are much better than those that just re-create stuff I see every day.

Paper Mario is another triumph from Nintendo, and once again strengthens my loyalty.  Nintendo may be losing the video-game wars, but they still know how to make a good game better than anyone else.",This is why I love Nintendo,1100822400,6,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

426852,5.0,True,"04 15, 2016",A2VB9T8SJ4X4Z3,B017W16ZNA,Erik,"This review is unbiased towards the censorship that occurred. Purely because I really didn't buy the game for it's politically correctness... I just wanted to play the game and I just so happen to not be able to read Japanese.

TLDR: I consider it to possibly be my favorite game on the 3DS. This, accounting for the bias that I actually didn't watch any videos. I have almost no idea about the overall story (aside from what I was able to pick up). So my review is purely on the gameplay. That being said, with rushing through the game without watching videos, you're looking at about 28hrs (Which justifies $40 IMO). It also should have fairly good replayability, not to mention many hidden dungeons and mega bosses.

Having played the first one, I was a bit apprehensive about the grind-to-come. This sequel brings a few things to the table that make huge improvements on the first one. With so many different classes, it'd be a pain to train them all  (4 times each), and they fixed that with chaining. That being said, the chaining can get you maxed out pretty quick. That also being said, you can max out pretty quickly, which makes the game easy. As for improvements, I'd say that is the best because it actually gives you an incentive to train things up. And with so many different classes, you actually CAN play using many different techniques. This is great because it actually gives the game a lot of replayability.

Aside from those changes, the game is VERY similar to the first. So if you loved the first but hated the grind, then I'm sure you'll like this. As well with the grinding, it almost becomes your own fault if you can't be a boss. (this is a jab at how the last boss on the first one could 1 hit TKO you at any moment, which made your builds have to be very specific). And that is where I'll leave my review of the game specifically

***General comments/complaints that may spoil***
- I found that team became overpowered fairly quickly. The bishop/spellcrafter is quite ridiculous. I found that once Yew was maxed on those, I had no reason to change him. This is slightly due to the chaining system.
- Speaking of overpowered, that same team that I had for probably 70% of the game lead me to beating it without ever using Bravely Second, or summoning a friend, or even using magic items.
- Because of the chaining system, I would just sit there and grind for a while and then turn off encounters when in dungeons. This way I could explore without worry, but still keep my levels up. This surely wasn't how things were intended, but it worked for me.
- I never really had any massive damage moments unless I criticaled, which still only net me about 4,000 damage. All of my physicals had triple wield and multitask though, so my net damage was usually 4-7k later on.","28 hours in, finally beat it.",1460678400,2,,

However, there are a few points of criticism:

For one, I had problems with the guitar controller. The strum bar broke pretty much as soon as I got the guitar, and I had to sign up for a replacement (which is yet to arrive). The process was simple, but still. This apparently is a problem a lot of people have, so that's disappointing.

Update: I received the replacement controller today, but they sent me a PS3 controller, which is useless to me. I checked my support request and I clearly requested the 360 version. So the saga continues. Argh!!!

Anyway: I like the guitar controller itself. Better even than any of the Guitar Hero controllers. It is a little bigger and heavier and it feels more like a real guitar. The ""solo buttons"" are cool too. The only thing that is not so cool is that the strum bar (even when it worked) didn't feel as good as the one on the Guitar Hero controller, since there doesn't seem to be a real noticable ""click"".

Another thing that struck me as odd is that the product ships with one guitar, a drum set, and a microphone. However, the game is made for lead-guitar, bass guitar, drums, and vocals. So you end up one guitar short. And the guitar controller isn't available for purchase separately? WTF?!?

Note: The Guitar Hero controller works with this game too, except that there are no ""solo buttons"" on the GH controller. But at least it gives you a second guitar, which works well as a bass guitar.

But anyway: Overall, I am having a blast with this game, so I am still giving it 5 stars. The songs are pretty good, and the selection of additional songs you can download (for a price) is extensive. The list of songs still doesn't quite hit the nail on the head as far as my personal taste is concerned (or what I would like to play in a game like this), but that is just a matter of personal preference. (I like Guitar Hero 3's selection better).

The drums are also cool to play. They are probably the hardest part of the game, so that even gives veterans something new to do. Plus there always is the singing thing, if you do not mind getting emberassed. ;-)

The visual style of the game is superior to Guitar Hero's comic style (IMO). Not that it seems to matter much in a game like this, but I guess it is important to some people.

Update: I got this game for christmas. It is now early April. I still have not been able to get a working controller from EA.

In the past, Mario games have defined the platformers of their generation.  From Super Mario Bros. over 20 years ago, to Super Mario 64 bringing platforming into 3D in a whole new light.  Super Mario Sunshine, however, did not turn nearly as many heads as Super Mario 64.  Understandable, seeing as how Super Mario 64 is a tough game to compare to.  Super Mario Galaxy does compare, though.  While it doesn't reinvent the wheel, it serves as an example of why Mario continues to rule the platforming genre.

Mario has never been a game to pick up for its storyline.  As usual, things are peaceful in the Mushroom Kingdom.  In this case, they're enjoying the star festival.  As usual, Bowser comes in and decides to stir up trouble.  He ends up kidnapping Princess Peach and once again its up to Mario to go rescue her.  In order to reach Bowser's hideout, though, he'll have to collect power stars to do so.  It borrows a lot from Super Mario 64 in the plot development, but this is hardly the same game.  Like all Mario games, the story is simplistic.  We've been saving Peach for over 20 years and it won't be stopping soon.  You do not pick up Super Mario Galaxy for its storyline.  It's all about the gameplay.

Like every Mario game, Galaxy is easy to pick up and learn but incredibly difficult to master.  Through your travels you'll control Mario as you tackle the bad guys of the Galaxy.  Mario's basic movies are all here.  He can jump, triple jump and spin.  It's very similar to Super Mario 64.  The obstacles in Mario's way however range from Bowser's troopers to natural disasters like black holes.  Getting every single star can be a tough task.  Like the other Mario games in the past, though, it isn't necessary to get every single star in order to fight the end boss.

There are also suits for Mario can wear in his travels.  There is the usual flower power and invincible star, but you'll also find new suits.  There's the bee suit, which lets Mario fly.  He can turn into a Boo and go through walls.  He can even become a spring.  Needless to say, there's a lot of variety in this gameplay.

There are several Wii games where the motion sensor controls have either been overused or they feel downright tacked on as an afterthought.  In Super Mario Galaxy that's not the case.  The motion sensor controls are not overused, nor are they forgotten about.  From time to time you may find yourself rolling a ball around using the Wii remote like a joystick.  Or you might be surfing on a manta ray.  You'll shake the remote to execute Mario's spin move, and there's also a star you can control to pick up star bits and fire them off at enemies.

There's also a multiplayer aspect to Super Mario Galaxy, but it's certainly not all that engaging.  Player 2 can use a separate remote to control a star and collect star bits and shoot them at enemies.  Player 2 can also hold enemies still for Mario and make him jump.  That's really all there is.  Nothing more.  It's interesting at first, but it's hard to shake the fact that player 2 just doesn't do a lot of anything.

Visually, Super Mario Galaxy is a pretty good looking game.  By far the best the Wii has to offer.  The detail is just incredible and the environments are gorgeous looking.  There's also a great deal of attention done with the physics.  It's fun to just jump up and watch Mario get pulled into the gravitational pull of another object.  It's pretty cool stuff.  If there was anything wrong with Super Mario Galaxy's presentation it would be that the player doesn't have complete control over the camera.  The camera work isn't bad but from time to time there will be an object in your way.  Luckily, this doesn't happen often enough to be a problem.

The game also sounds brilliant.  Easily some of the best music the series has ever had.  You'll hear remixed tunes from previous Mario adventures as well as whole lot of new stuff.  It's perfectly orchestrated.  There isn't a whole lot of voice acting in Super Mario Galaxy aside from Mario's shouts and screams and Bowser grunting.  This probably won't bother most players as there isn't much story in the game anyway.

Super Mario Galaxy is a great game.  It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it has fantastic gameplay that is unmatched and unparalleled.  If you're a Wii owner, this is the game to get.

Pros:

+Strong and varied gameplay
+Gorgeous looking environments
+There's co-op play for those who want it
+The game sounds really good
+Tight intuitive controls

Cons:

-The multiplayer is not very involving
-The player doesn't have control over the camera, which can be a burden in some spots",Out of This World,1194998400,9,,

The graphics are beautiful, the story line is amazing, the AI is really smart, and the action can get really intense. I've played Far Cry 2 before (horrible, do not waste your money on it) and this seems to not even be related in anyway to it. The thing i like most about this game is that it is free roam, the map is HUGE, and it can keep you in suspense at the perfect times. The story has alot of weird twists an turns that really throw you off guard, but make for a good story none the less.
 The few things i didn't like about this game was that there wasn't much interaction with any of the NPC's, you could be walking around a village, and not be able to speak to anyone aside from the occasional side mission. Along with that the voice overs for secondary characters was awful, their mouth would be totally out of synch with what they were saying. Also for the weapons, as you progress through the story you get to unlock special versions of guns you already have, but they are weak compared to things you probably have by the time you unlock them. I think if you put the work in to unlocking it, it should be worth while. Lastly, vehicles are the main mode of transportaion in Far Cry 3, and if not for the fast travel you'd have to depend heavily on them. They are easy to total and without a piece of equipment called the repair tool, your on foot for awhile because vehicles are spread to far and thin between viallages and outposts.
 Aside from those things the game was incredible. They are just minor problems, and not that bad to deal with, every game has it's problems.

we purchased this for our sons 9th birthday.  We were apprehensive over the fact that after 5 editions of the same game they would be repetitive...Once again we were pleasantly surprised.  Mario and friends have been entertaining our boys for years and continue to do so with Mario Party 5!
We love the board game concept...the  boys love the mini games.  It is an easy game for mom's and dad's to join in and play too.

Mario Party 5's concept is easy to understand, the games are easy enough to play to make it interesting for all ages.
Mario Party games are always in the active play file!;  at least in our home.  It seems as if Mario Party 5 took the same great concept and just expanded it to include much more.
Our boys love it!  It makes them laugh!  That is music to our ears!

156681,5.0,False,"07 8, 2012",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B00149ND28,Lisa Shea,"Mirror's Edge is a fairly unique game that's all about the gameplay style. You are running, jumping, sliding, and moving towards a goal, no matter what the obstacles.

A critical thing to understand here is that the start-up period of the game is ROUGH. You are expected to be able to wall-jump, balance on thin rails, jump over chasms, and do other challenging things. The controls are going to be hard to get used to. Don't give up. It could be frustrating. Stick at it, and give yourself time to get used to those controls. Keep working through the initial levels. The reward is well worth it.

Once you become used to the controls, the game really becomes captivating. You're expected to race top speed through a variety of obstacle courses. You have to think on the fly, react instantly, and pay attention to clues. It draws your mind in to focus on the moment.

You can replay levels to try different paths, to try to get a better speed, and simply to have fun. So even if you ""solve"" a level in one way, there are reasons to go back and replay them multiple times.

This isn't a long, drawn out epic game that requires 80 hours of in depth juggling of stats and memorizing family trees. You can get through a complete start-to-finish run of the game in about ten hours. So you can learn all the basics in the game in a long weekend of playing - and then replay given levels that you love as you have time. So on one hand you can rent the game to see what it's like. If the gameplay is a style you adore, then you can keep replaying levels to your heart's content.

I think it's important to mention two things.

First, again, the start-up challenge is there. Some people will have issues making it through the first level or two. The controls are not ""natural"" for many players to master. Stick with it. Give yourself kudos for trying, and keep at it. It's well worth it.

Second, if you get motion sick in games, this game might trigger it. There is a lot of fast movement, deep chasms, and swirling skies. So if you tend to be prone to those issues, you might want to try the game out first to see how well you do with it.

So with those things said, this game has an enormous amount of fun to offer. Well recommended!

The amazingly epic, handcrafted world, the superb narratives told both in the main story and the side quests, the stunning graphics, the tight & refined gameplay...nearly every aspect of the game has been praised. The game has received the best critical and commercial response of any RPG since The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim released nearly 4 years ago, and perhaps has even surpassed that wonderful game in the way it's captured the hearts and minds of gamers.

And you know what? None of it is exaggerated. It's all true. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the best video games ever made. It's certainly the best fantasy-themed Western RPG I've ever played, and I've played, and continue to play, a LOT of these types of games. Every second of the game, even the parts of the game that seem to drag a bit, absolutely oozes the love and care that these wonderful developers at CD Projekt RED put into the game. There simply aren't many games out there that are being made at this level, and getting the chance to spend over 70 hours in this world was an absolute joy.

At this point, I'm not sure what else I can contribute to the conversation that hasn't been talked to death about already. One thing for me that really resonates about The Witcher 3 is how mechanically ""pure"" the game is. What I mean by that is how seemingly every aspect of the game's mechanics seem to be 100% focused on keeping the player involved and invested in the stories and the gameplay. Most RPG's are very dense in their systems and their mechanics. 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition, another game that I absolutely adore, is a great example of this. It is a game that is just as much about managing game systems as it is exploring the world and experiencing the tale it tells. The Witcher 3 is the exact opposite of a game like Dragon Age: Inquisition. Yes, there's an alchemy system that can be very deep if you want it to be. And you'll definitely spend a good amount of time managing your inventory, which may be the one weakness of the game that stands out (although it has been subsequently improved through patches. The developer has done an incredible job supporting the game). But in general, The Witcher 3 is a much more mechanically streamlined experience than most other games in its genre. Magics are simple and limited. Combat consists of two types of attacks using two types of swords. The absolutely stellar side quests aren't focused around the rewards you'll receive or the experience points you'll amass, but rather on the stories they tell. They're used to build the world. If they build your character in the process, it feels like a secondary result.

And speaking of the game's world, perhaps more than any other RPG I've ever played, this feels like a world that has existed for a long time. Now, yes, this game is the third in a trilogy, and the world of The Witcher existed prior to the games in literature. But the places in The Witcher 3 you explore just feel so authentic and lived-in. It feels like a place with history, and because the game has you spending minimal time thinking about and dealing with its mechanics, you can really in turn absorb yourself in this beautiful place in a way you just don't with other games of this magnitude. And what an amazing place it is. It can be argued that there has never been a game of this scale that looks as good as this. It undeniably has the best lighting effects I've ever seen in a video game. It's absolutely jaw-dropping when the sun rises and sets, how the sky changes color in correlation with the dynamic weather system in the game. I was in awe of the game's presentation for the entire duration of my time with it. Truly a masterful achievement.

For this reviewer, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt closes out what I consider to be the best modern series of video game RPG's that I've played. I fell in love with the first two games in the series (see my reviews), and somehow, they've managed to out do those two masterpieces and create this, one of the best RPG's ever made and easily a contender for the best game of 2015, a year full of absolutely stellar releases. Just buy this game, even if you haven't played the first two, and bask in the video game mastery that is The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. This is one you'll always remember.",Every bit as good as you've heard,1446681600,9,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Head tracking is just absolutely mandatory for flight sims, however, so I bought the TrackIR 5 with TrackClip Pro.
This thing is just great. It was super easy to set up -- no tweaking required! All I have to do is press ""F12"" to center the camera when I start and everything ""just works"". Movement is super-responsive, I don't get any jittery, shaky movement because of the software's great smoothing settings (which are set by default), and the default ""dead zone"" in the center feels just right. they really did a great job.

From what I've read, there is no performance benefit to buying the TrackClip Pro, and it costs extra. I suggest buying it if and only if you cannot wear a baseball cap (for example, if you are using headphones or a head set). the reason is that the reflector that comes with TrackIR5 is designed to sit on a baseball cap. TrackClip pro, instead, clips to the side of your headset and works wonderfully.

I used the Naga mouse for a little over a year before trading it for a ""regular"" mouse (one without a num-pad on the side) after growing frustrated with its shortfalls.  I was excited to try the G600 to see if Logitech managed to rectify some of those problems....

Size: The logitech is just a bit longer, but its equally wide as the Naga MMO.  Weight: The logitech feels a little lighter, but less ""cheap.""  I always felt like I could squeeze the Naga hard enough to break it-- it felt cheap and insubstantial in my hand.  The logitech mouse feels like a higher grade plastic, but its light weight still causes it to feel cheap in my opinion.

The crowning feature of this mouse, of course, is the side num-pad.  In terms of feel, the individual buttons feel much more distinct compared to the Naga.  Without glancing at your hand, its easy to tell based on feel where your thumb is.  For the Naga, this was a huge problem and learning curve for most users as the buttons were continuous with one another.  The downside to Logitech's approach is that you aren't able to roll your thumb across several buttons fluidly the same way you can with the Naga.

Software:  The logitech is simple to customize and program if you are running a Windows-based PC.  If you are using a Mac, forget using any special software for customization.  However, within World of Warcraft, it is possible to set key binds using the in-game key bind menu.  I can't speak to different MMOs available on Mac.

Overall: Logitech has put out another high quality product with the G600.  This is a quality mouse and well worth the investment for hardcore MMO (PvE) players.  If you're more likely to PVP or for the more casual MMO gamer, you might prefer to stick with one of Logitech's other offerings in order to gain more versatility from your mouse for other types of games (i.e. First person shooters, etc...)

I have to admitt, my ""new best friend"" is my Nintendo DS with ""My Chinese Coach"". Yes, sometimes it lacks perfect accuracy when it comes to the word or phrase a native Chinese would use, however, most of the time it's ""spot on"" and it's close enough. Quite simply, it lets me practice in a way a person learning the language never could without it. I know this game catches a lot of ""flak"" for making you learn Chinese characters, but, hey, that's the way things are over here. Busses, taxies, menue items, everything is written with Chinese characters and you either ""learn em, or die"". Progress is a little slow at first, but, just apply yourself and stick with it. You'll get it. I was over at a friends house for Chinese New Years ""Eve"" and his nine year old boy got ahold of it. The kid opened up ten new levels in about two hours. Of course, I will go back through those levels to work the subject matter, but it just illustrates an option. If progress is dragging for you, just hand it to some Chinese ""kid"". New levels and games will be opened in ""no time"".
So, yea, if you're a person who wants to learn Chinese, go ahead and sign up for that Chinese class at the local community college, but get My Chinese Coach as a helper. If you're someone who is going to be traveling to China for business or pleasure, definitely get ""My Chinese Coach"".

I had never dissassembled a PS4 controller so I checked a few videos on YouTube for the recommended procedure. For the first controller I used a sharp pocket knife and CAREFULLY separated the 2 outside sides of the controller by wedging the knife in and flexing slightly. After a little effort, it popped apart fairly easy. Overall, I was quickly able to get to the necessary sections to swap these parts by following the YouTube instructions.

After initial assembly I had a problem with the R1 button and right stick. They would activate randomly and caused all sorts of issues with my games. So... I took it apart again... it came apart much easier this time. After 3 times of taking it apart and making sure all the rubber button pads were set properly the controller worked perfectly. I must have had one or more of the internal rubber pads out of place the first and second time around.

Note: I would recommend doing this over a white paper towel to catch parts that may drop out. I also had to attach the L2 and R2 buttons as they popped off during dissassembly. Be careful not to lose the small springs that attach to the R1 and R2 buttons and the short rubber rod for the reset button. Those are the easiest parts to lose. I also took this opportunity to spray some compressed air into the inside where the control sticks press into place. I also used 91% Rubbing Alcohol and Q-Tips to clean the gaps around the controller... so it looks nearly like new.

For my second controller, as I am now a ""pro"" at taking the PS4 controller apart... it took me less than 15 minutes to complete... after testing it on a couple games, everything works perfectly.

I can recommend these highly as they look and feel terrific. Also, the aluminum is not going to wear out like the rubberized original sticks.

184367,5.0,False,"07 31, 2010",A3EUL7LI5UYE8P,B001SGZL2W,Stephen,"Red Dead Redemption is an epic game that few games could rival.  Everything from the way nature lives and breathes to the way the wind blows in your hair are so realistic and life-like that they make Red Dead Redemption seem more like a movie than a game.  Not to mention its gripping storyline that follows former outlaw John Marston on his quest to settle his past.  Throughout the story, John meets a variety of different and interesting characters from swindling salesmen to Mexican banditos.  The whole selection of weapons that John wields are as varied as the people he meets.  From classic six shooters and Winchester repeaters to deadly throwing knives and fire bombs, John makes quick work of his foes.  This is a game you won't soon forget.

The story starts off with John being escorted onto a train bound for a small town in the middle of the desert.  His mission is to capture or kill an old friend of his.  But it wasn't his choice; FBI agents kidnapped John's family and threatened to kill them if he didn't comply.  So John finds himself in this predicament and has to do what he has to do.  But when the time comes, it doesn't work out so well and John has to try again, this time killing every man in his way, one man at a time.

There are also a lot of funny lines in the game.  Some are said by John and some are said by random people.  Here's a list of some funny lines:

Uncle: ""You sound like you have a bad case of Hemorrhoids.""
John: ""You're about to be suffering from a bad case of someone just shot me in the face if you don't do what you're told!""

John: ""You're so crooked, you swallow nails and spit out corkscrews!""

John: ""You keep talkin' and I'm gonna put a bullet in that hillbilly head of yours, and watch your idiot brains spill out.""

Irish: ""What's the spanish word for c**t?""
John: ""You tell me...you must have been called it a few times.""

John: (while skinning a deer) ""Let me take your coat madam.""

John: ""I'll give you an insight. I'll show you your own guts.""

Revolutionary: ""De Santa is the type of man who likes to shoot men when they're on their knees.""
John: ""I bet he likes to do other stuff to men on their knees as well.""

Soldier: ""I have a bad feeling about this...""
John: ""Maybe you just need to take a piss or something.""

There are a whole lot of things to do in Red Dead.  First off, there is an economy.  You make money on missions, on selling goods, or looting it from dead bodies or chests.  In every major town there is a general store, doctor, gunsmith, and saloon.  In the first three stores, you can buy and sell things.  Some things you can buy are: maps, ammo, guns, health, bait, and horses.  Some things you can sell are: herbs and animal skins.  You find these two throughout the whole world.  Different species of animals and plants can be found in certain areas and sometimes you have to find a certain kind of animal and it is challenging to know where to look for it.  You can also play Texas Hold 'Em poker, blackjack, liars dice, five finger fillet, horseshoes and arm wrestling.  If you don't know what poker, blackjack, horseshoes and arm wrestling are, you might want to get out more.  Five finger fillet is the game where you stab the knife in between your fingers quickly and try to beat the time limit and liars dice is a game where you try not to get caught lying about your dice under a cup and try to catch your opponent lying.  If you are talented in these areas, this is a great way to make money.

Apart from making money, there are two different ratings for your character; Honor and Fame.  Honor determines how people react to you.  It can go up or down based on your actions.  To receive good honor: help innocent people, take prisoners alive, return stolen money or fight bandits.  To receive bad honor: kill innocent people, kill prisoners, keep stolen money or help the bandits.  Having good honor will get you a discount in stores, make your items worth more when you sell, and make the law more lenient of you.  Having bad honor will do the opposite.  Fame will make strangers come up to you more often and ask for help and it also makes the law for lenient(for example, if you have really high fame, when committing a crime, the bounty placed on your head is half of what it would normally be).  Whether you choose to help strangers is your choice.  That is the most wonderful thing about Red Dead, so many thigns are optional it seems like you are blazing your own path.  Also makes great for replay value, one time play the good guy and next time play the bad guy.

There are also two jobs that are available in major towns.  Horse breaking and nightwatch.  The former is lassoing a wild horse, jumping on top of it and moving the analog stick back and forth to stay centered.  It lasts for 15 or 20 seconds, then the horse suddenly stops and is broken in.  While this is fun, you only make about $6-10 for it, so this isn't a job you should spend a lot of time at.  The latter only can be done at night (obviously) and is where you follow a dog around and stop trouble.  It usually is breaking up a fight, stopping a cattle rustler, or saving a woman from a gang.  When it is over you go to the police and they give you cash.  Often times, it is over $100! Not bad money.

There are also different outfits, just like in GTA games.  The first one that is also the standard one is the bounty hunter outfit.  You can unlock outfits by finding objects, completing jobs or tasks or buying scraps of clothing at tailors.  Most outfits have special talents.  The bounty hunter, duster (where you wear an old duster that doesn't do anything except make you look cool), and cattle rancher outfits don't have any abilities.  But the elegant suit outfit makes it possible to cheat at poker, the several gang outfits make you less apt to get shot at by that particular gang, the US marshal outfit makes the lawmen turn a blind eye at some of your crimes and there are other outfits that I have yet to unlock like a US army uniform and a bureau uniform.

The world of Red Dead looks awesome.  Whether you're up in the high mountains of America with snow on the ground hunting grizzlies or you're down in Mexico with dust flying all over the place hunting Armadillos, the graphics and animation will be superb.  Weapons look great too.  You of course have your standard six shooters and repeaters.  But you also have shotguns, sniper rifles, knives, throwing knives, dynamite, fire bombs and a lasso.  You start out with bad guns and get better ones as you progress.  For example, you start out with a pretty bad six shooter and eventually can get a fully automatic German pistol.  You can use the lasso to capture horses or take criminals alive.  Taking them alive for bounty missions earns you twice as much money!

Yes there are showdowns.  It wouldn't be a western without them.  It is necessary for a few missions, but most of the time it is optional.  Usually while riding through a town, some gunslinger leaning against a post would yell ""I heard you're pretty fast with a gun, care to prove it?"".  You could either accept and then when the time is right activate the red dead meter and kill him or you could walk away.  Accepting will get you a small amount of fame and you can always loot his body for some small dinero.  I've actually found that the showdowns are difficult for me.  I might have missed something, but I'm not sure.

The characters, guns, trees, animals and all other aspects come together to make a great western that has a tense story with a shocking finish and is full of hours of wild west action using pistols, rifles, Gatling guns, or just plain old knives.  Red Dead Redemption is worth the money and also has an interesting and challenging online multiplayer that is also open world just like the game.

Bottom line: RDR is a great game that allows you choose your path and with the superb graphics, depth, and details when it ends, you feel like a part of you went with it.","Strap on your six shooters, grab your Winchester, mount your horse and don't forget your hat.",1280534400,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Having never played a Persona game before, this was a very new type of game for me.  The stylistic anime graphics are great, and the game is quite fun, although some of the core mechanics are very grindy.  I have spent way too much time playing it.  There's also a very jazzy music track that will get stuck in your head.

Some parts of the game seem very Pokemon, but with more RPG elements.  The graphics lag sometimes, and I noticed terrible frame rates walking around in places.  That being said, most of the graphics are just awesome manga style stills and cutscenes anyways and it the lag didn't really impact my experience of the game very much.

The best part of the game is actually the non-fighting part where you focus on character development and have to carefully plan your time out.  I really enjoyed how the game is broken into two very different styles of time-management and RPG gameplay.","New to Persona games, this was a nice surprise.",1499212800,5,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

""Skies of Arcadia: Legends"" for the Nintendo Gamecube is a remake of the game ""Skies of Arcadia"". It takes place in a world that floats in the clouds. There are islands of rock that float in the air, where people have made their homes and villages. To get from island to island, airships were made, using the power of the Six Moons. The Six Moons are each different colors: Red, Yellow, Purple, Blue, Green, and Silver. They represent, respectively, Fire, Electricity, Ice, Wind, Life, and ""Void"". The Moons drop moonstones, which can be used to power things, like airships and weapons. Each Moon has a continent that represents it, and the continent uses the power of the moon to their best advantage. The Nayr people live under the Red Moon, and they are a desert culture. The Valuans have established a great technological empire from the electricity of the Yellow Moon. There is a lot of unexplored space, and nobody really knows what lies beyond his or her little realms.

The game opens with a small, sleek, shiny ship being chased by a giant metal Valuan battleship in a scene reminiscent of the opening from Star Wars. The person on the smaller ship is a young woman. The captain of the larger ship, Alfonse, seems to be a rich pretty-boy. He says that the girl is from the ""Silver Continent"" and orders that concussion shells be fired at the smaller ship to knock the young woman unconscious. The sailors do so, and she is taken aboard. Suddenly, the bigger ship rocks from an explosion! They're being attacked by Air Pirates! The main character, Vyse, a boy who uses two cutlasses in battle, swings down from the Crow's Nest of the pirate ship and challenges a group of soldiers. Then his best friend Aika, a girl with a boomerang, jumps over, too. They battle the soldiers, then when the rest of the pirates come, run off to search for the captain. While Vyse and Aika fight some more Valuan Soldiers, the captain gets away. The Air Pirates bring the girl (Fina) onto their ship and tell her they are Blue Rogues, who only attack armed ships, unlike the Black Pirates, who attack defenseless ships. The pirates all go back to the very creatively named Pirate Island, where they celebrate their victory. Vyse and Aika introduce Fina to all the people of the island, and then go off exploring for a day. When they come back, the island has been attacked, and the Valuan Armada has taken Fina and all the Pirates away. Then Vyse and Aika decide to go rescue their friends from the evil Valuan Empire's clutches.

The graphics in this are good, as RPGs go. It is an enhanced version of an older game, so the graphics are nothing like, say, Final Fantasy 10. The sound and music are very nice, as with most RPG games. Where this game is the character, world, and gameplay design. The characters range from Vyse, the average do-gooder anime-style RPG character, to Drachma, a sailor done in the style of Captain Ahab, who lost his arm to a giant Arcwhale (a whale that swims in air) called Rhaknam. Unlike Ahab, however, Drachma was able to get a mechanical metal arm. The world in this is pretty big, though some things in it (like walls of air that prevent you from going places) don't make a lot of sense. The airships are cool, though, and you can upgrade your ship with armor and cannons, to fight in ship-to-ship battles. The overall effect of the towns, including people in them, buildings, and surroundings, are pretty neat. Also, the detail in the gameplay and battles amaze me. Unlike many RPGs, in Skies of Arcadia: Legends, characters will fight in the background (but not do any damage) while they wait for their turn. Last, there are less ""Random Encounters"" than in Final Fantasy, which means you can walk quite a bit without running into an enemy. Overall, this is an incredibly good RPG. 10/10.",Review Written on Release,1341619200,,,

Now, I'm iffy about my FF games and didn't really want to try it out because of all the reviews I saw on here.  But hell, since I like any fantasy game, I gave it a shot...and dude...it's AWESOME!!!  Vincent's past/present is finally revieled in this FFVII game!  Cause at first I was wondering why he was sitting in front of that crystal in the awesome movie Advent Children.  This game explains the reason why and the reason why he looks like a depressing vampire.  Cause before this happened, he looked howt!  Not hot, but howt!  Though my fav character off of FFVII is Sephiroth but Vincent is awesome too!  I'm highly horrible at shoot - up games, but this is for me is in between easy and not so easy...expecially when you go against the boss battles, yeesh!  But anywho, the game itself is highly good but the grafics are like playing Devil May Cry 3 or FFX.  Not saying the grafics are bas but...uh...needs a bit of some work.  Other than that it's awesome!

ESPN on the other hand is the same but different.  I think gameplay wise the games are very similar, but ESPN allows you to do more running moves, by doing combos and charging up power.  While this sounds like an arcade game, it's actually very realistic.  They have a cribs feature for awards, and an awesome First Person mode.

For example when you are running from the CIA you control Jodie the main protagonist when you need to get out of tight situations you use her spiritual counterpart Aiedon (I don't know if I'm spelling it right) to either say Jodie is ducking for cover and you are pinned down with two CIA operatives shooting at you, you can manipulate objects to kill them Carrie style or possess them like a ghost and make them kill each other trust me its allot more fun than it sounds. Bottom line if you love a great Scifi story that is different and beautiful graphics and is a fan of Heavy Rain then you will love this game just don't expect in depth gameplay like Assassins Creed or anything like that.",One of the most unique games I have played in years,1430092800,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

341692,5.0,True,"05 25, 2014",A5GCWW51V5SH7,B00HLT0YT0,Kiteless,"I have a long history with the ""PlayStation Portable"" systems. I had the original PSP, then got bored of it, then got the second gen, then the PSP with the slide up display and no UMD. What was I thinking!?

Enter the PS Vita. Well I got the 1st gen and played the heck out of Unit 13. Loved the great graphics, solid controls, and little bite sized missions. Played it sooooo much, but there were really no good games (for me) to play.... Again, I got bored of it and sold it.

When I saw they had come out with a slim version, the ""Portable PlayStation"" called to me again. I decided importing it to get the cool colors was not worth the expense. I was patient and waited. When it shoed up on Amazon I got the bundle with a $60 USD gift card and free overnight shipping. Came to $160 flat after tax. Woohoo!

WHen it finally arrives I was impressed. People himed and hawed about the lack of an AMOLED screen. It was a very nice screen, but I felt the colors popped a bit too much! The LCD has very nice colors, and very fast response times. No streaking at all and the colors feel great, but they don't ""pop"". Some people like that.

I love the ergonomics of the system, it really feels great in the hands. Soft and curved with the back touch pad pulled back a bit. I never hit it by accident, but I feel like someone with smaller hands may have trouble reaching it without repositioning their hands.

Battery life is also very good. Even playing Borderlands 2, a game that seems to really push the Vita to it's limit, I get 5 - 6 hours. Honestly I can't sit and play for more than 4 hours MAX anyway so this has been fine for me. On that note the micro USB charge port is AAAAMMMAAAZZZIIIING!!!!111!!!!!1111!!oneoneone  Seems like such a small thing, but it makes the system truely portable. If I'm traveling and I have my call phone charger with me, it works.

Something about charging with a 3rd party charger. The charger it comes with is 1.5A I believe, so I assumed you would need a high power USB charger to juice it up. As a test I have this super cheapy crappy 500mw (half an amp) charger that's actually rather slim. It has a USB port in it and using a 3rd party USB cable, it did actually charge at only 500mw. This is really great for Sony to have made the charging circuit smart enough to deal with such a slow charge. It is VERY SLOW, but I works. I keep this super slim USB charger and a small USB cable in the OEM softcase that was made for the original vita. It has a zipper pocket on one side that the Vita slips into and another zipper on the other half with 2 vecro let pockets in it for carts. I keep the charger, USB cable, micro fiber cloth and a few ""naked"" game carts in there.

Also if you are reading this Sony, KEEP MAKING GAME CARTS!!! Please!!! Not everyone can spend over $100 for your special overpriced memory cards!

So what about Borderlands? Well I already played it with friend on the PC for well over 100 hours. Maybe 200 hours at LAN partys and over the Internet. It's a fantastic game. Normally I'm a mouse & keyboard guy with it comes to first person shooter games, so the controls took a lot of getting used to. But as such they are well layed out. After getting used to them about the only 2 things I still do are accidentally throw a grenade by touching the bottom left side of the screen, and pushing the wrong button to get out of the darn vehicles.

As mentioned in some major gaming sites the frame rate does lag from time to time. It's never a deal killer. There are also less enemies on the screen and when you kill a bad guy he explodes like a big blood and bone balloon. At first it was annoying, but it's also kind of satisfying. The game is very challenging and there are lots of side missions. A good thing too because you really need to complete as many side missions as you can to get your level up as high as possible by the time you reach the end. Don't worry, no spoilers!

3 annoying things about Borderlands. You can't skip any of the opening title logos. Yes, I know it's Borderlands, YEEES I know it's 2K Games and YEEEEES I freaking know it's Gearbox! Can we get on with it. Second problem is that the load times are a bit harsh. Some levels take well over 30 seconds to load, sometimes up to a minute. On a portable taking a long time to get back into a game and waiting for load times is rather annoying. Finally the game is a bit crash happy. There is a particularly long mission I was on just last night, I got all the way to the end, beat the boss of that stage, and the game froze. The Vita has this nice crash report system. I sent the crash report for what must have been the 3rd time, and when I got back into it. I had to go through it alllll over again. Oddly,, and thankfully, it remembered all the experience I had gained, but all the loot I had was gone, and all the bad guys had to be dealt with again. I was really annoyed by this to say the least. But I plowed through it again, and sprinted full speed to the level exit incase it happened again. Now when I'm done with a long play session, I quit the game, and then go back into it when I'm ready to play it again.

I gave this 5 starts because I DO LOVE IT! But there are some down sides. Or maybe just gripes. All of my gripes seems to fall in line with what Sony seems to have done to cut costs and keep a profit margin. Understandable, but still annoying...

Borderlands does not come on a cart, it comes in the form of a voucher. You go into the store, and redeem the voucher and put nearly 6GB of Borderlands on your 8GB memory card. OUCH! Add a few game and system updates, along with a couple more small games and you're done. Gee I would love to re-download Wipeout and play through that but I can't. Just not enough room. It took a long while to download and install.

My second gripe is that these memory cards are crazy expensive. over $100 USD for a 64gb card! That's just a slap in the face of the consumer. It's almost like Sony doesn't want me to sign up for a PlayStation Plus account. A high quality Sandisk 64GB ""Ultra"" Micro SD card is less than $40 USD.

Finally, lack of accessories at launch. Even 3rd party was lacking. But I would have liked to see a hard case specifically designed for the Vita Slim. I went with the soft case because it was all I could find before my long international trip, and it was like $9 USD used at the local major game retailer chain.

Bottom line, it's the Vita you have been waiting for! Wonderful screen, solid performance and battery life. If you like FPS games and especially if you can play it with a friend, Borderlands 2 is fun, with a great story, and at times hilarious, if a bit morbid. This review is way longer than I expected it to be so play forgive my spelling, grammer and typos. I'm not going to bother to proof it. I hope you find it useful. :)

I'll start with the singlplayer. First the singleplayer maps are huge, there are plenty of vehicles, humor is funny(mainly from Sweetwater and Haggard), when you die you start right from where you left off(for example if you kill an entire squad but the last guy kills you when you respawn he'll be the only one left. This feature is very useful when your at a hard part in the game.), 90% of the enviornment is destructable(interior walls, some crates, and floors aren't destructable but will be in the sequel), and its long becuase of the huge maps.
Oh and the voice acting is topnotch and funny. The only con is the backstory about the war going on. It seems that WW III happened but RUS and USA are just using conventional tactics instead of nukes, so that is kind of confussing to me. So heres my review of the singleplayer-

Fun 5/5
Graphics 5/5
Plot 3/5
Difficulty 4/5
Replay value 5/5
Overall 4.5/5
Now for the multiplayer aspect. It is very fun, there are tons of people online(about 500,000 every day), the game mode Gold Rush( basically 1 team destroys 2 gold creates and the other defends them[Its harder than it sounds]) is very fun, and there are many maps to play on(about 11). Now for the cons. You can only voice chat with squad members(4 people out of 12 on your side), it requires a bit to much team work if not every one is using a headset, and there are only two game modes(Gold Rush and conquest)! But this isn't that bad because both are very fun. So my review of the multiplayer is-

Fun 5/5
Graphics 5/5
Plot N/A
Replay Value 4/5
Overall 4.75/5

So if you want a COD style shooter that makes you use your head(like an enemy blowing up your cover this is for you)

Some thoughts:
- Lots more to do other than climbing platforms and jumping around.
- A solid well thought out story that keeps you going.
- Stealth, shooting, archery, melee combat...its all here for you to enjoy to some degree.
- Lots of stuff to go back and collect. The save system works very well.
- Lots of stuff to upgrade and skills to acquire which sort of gives an RPG element to the game.
- Sounds, music, voice acting and graphics are amazing.
- Gameplay...and this is important: the gameplay is fun and the quicktime events and combat do not detract from exploring or figuring out the puzzles in the game.

I was very skeptic when I bought this game but after putting in double digit hours I can say its worth every penny I paid for and enjoyed every minute of the game. Great return for a classic series.

The concept is a reality thanks to Tim Sweeney spending 3 years in his garage. At the time this was the reason to buy a graphics cards like a Voodoo or a TNT and run it on your Windows 95 system. For those of you who could barely run it, well now is the time to give it a go again because modern cards can run this game with ease and the game is worth it.

I finished playing this again on a high end system and am very happy that I did. It really is a deep game, lots of levels, lots of running around, lots of shooting, mindless blasting, pressing levers, going through levels that have some maze qualities, running across the same bad guys with some variations, the textures, AI and level design is surprisingly still able to deliver on a satisfactory game play. I would even go as far to say that this beats a lot of fps games that have since been released. It is an all-time great so for those of you gamers out there who remember the end of the 90s and remember what it was like to play fps games that people would line up around the block to buy, then get it, play it and cherish it.

I found the artwork beautifully rendered, one the most important elements of any game, as far as I'm concerned. In addition, the puzzles were both fun and challenging. Over all, the game never failed to keep me interested, since most scenes required me to figure out what to do next, without actually telling me what was required at the beginning of each scene, and I found that added an element of ""reality"", which I enjoyed. With most games, I usually turn the music off, because I find it distracting, but this game's music was pleasantly soothing and unintrusive, so I chose to keep it on low.

First of all, this game is leaps and bounds better than Unity. The game is not broken, but the occasional glitch rears its ugly head. However, the characters are interesting, the story in engaging, and 1868 London looks beautiful.

I think the Assassin's Creed series would benefit greatly if Ubisoft ceased production for a couple of years, reevaluate the story, and decide (as a team) how to improve the game. In the mean time, if you are a fan of the series, you will like Syndicate. It is a reflection of the days of old when Ezio and Altair scaled rooftops in pursuit of Templars.

I mean the graphics are REALLY good, but that's only if you're playing at 4:3, which is what I play on luckily, but if you play at 16:9, it'll be a lesser experience for you in the graphical department, but still looks good. The music, characters, everything, all top notch. They didn't hold anything back except widescreen support lol. The motion controls are epic, I love swinging at the screen, being a fighter an all, I get a surprisingly good workout from this game doing something I love. I mean it's one of the greatest games of all time, AND you're getting in your cardio, doesn't get much sweeter than that lol.

Career mode is very good, some new characters were added but they fit in just fine and add to the content so that's a plus. Multiplayer mode is tons of fun and is where you REALLY get a workout, especially if the two people playing are good at it. I'm glad they don't force motion controls though cuz it'll wear you down if you really get in to your video games like I do. When I get burned out, I just set the control scheme to the old NES days and play without motion controls. When I'm rested, I'm back at it swinging again lol. It would have been pretty neat if they had wifi boxing matches our tournaments. That would just make this game perfect actually but hey, you can't get everything.

 Luckily for me, I bought this game right when it hit the shelfs ;) . I think the only way you can get one is by buying it from someone or getting it off an auction.
 Anyway, the story is amazing. It's preety confusing at first, but if you REALLY pay attention you should understand it. But this game is for people 13+ years old, because younger kids would never get this story.  But like i said, it is amazing and it is written perfectley.
 The gameplay is very fun. The battles, unlike the final fantasy series, are very fun to play. You get to use combos, magic, etc. etc. etc.  You press triangle for weak attack, square for medium attack, and x for strong attack. Its great. Most rpgs just have an attack command an stuff.

274182,5.0,True,"10 11, 2012",A1033LWHDCAJNQ,B0083CJ2X8,S. Ali Limonadi,"Everything from all the previous Kingdom Hearts games, especially 1 & 2, has been leading up to this.

I'm NOT going to spoil anything, but just in case you keep making excuses to not get this game:

You find out who the man in the Brown Robe is.

You find out every single thing about Organization 13.

You find out what Riku is. (a blank blank).

You find out who Xemnes is. (you only think you know, but this game will let you know the real deal)

2 of the worlds are waking worlds, not sleeping. And there's a 8th for pure cinematic.

To unlock secret ending:

Beginners mode is 10 to 13 tropies.

Normal is 7 tropies......easy without even trying.

Proud mode is just 3, I believe.

I play with the 3D ON & all the way up 24/7 on every game, including, this......and I must say that games like this & Paper Mario & Kid Icarus & Luigi's Mansion were made for 3D.

there was a few places were the frame rate dropped for 1 to 3 seconds, but if you did a Wireless Update and have either 4.2.0-9U or 4.4.0-10U then you won't have any problem.......and the latest Wireless Update Firmware is currently 4.4.0-10U.

But the PS3 & 360 only do up to 24 fps with the 3D ON 24/7......so I have no complaints about the 3DS......especially now that I have Wireless Firmware Update 4.4.0-10U.

The 3D Augmented Realty requires 0 cards, but you can use the cards to unlock rare Partners.

Flowmotion is one of the easiest things to do in this game.

You can Link & Dual Link with Spirits......I ended up just doing Dual Link for crazy new abilities during mostly Boss Battles. (because you have to build up your Link Gauge).

There's also Reality Shift, which is more easier to do by just using your fingers on the Touch Screen, but sometimes I would used the Stylus after entering Reality Shift for certain things, like if it's a Sword for cutting the White Chains & Links on th touch screen.

FYI According to the guy that makes every Kingdom Hearts game......""Reality Shift gives you a glimpse of a new gameplay that is exclusive to Kingdom Hearts 3 Only""..........at first this didn't make sense to me because each World has a completely different gameplay functionality for Reality Shift..........but then I thought about what they all have in common, which is Dual Screen interaction......so basically Kingdom Hearts 3 is either coming out on the Wii U or 3DS or both.

Anyways everything has been leading up to Kingdom Hearts 3D, so I don't know what they are going to do in Kingdom Hearts 3, because everything has already been done in Kingdom Hearts 3D.

But they do have a Tutorial for the previous 6 Kingdom Hearts games to read inside Kingdom Hearts 3D, so it's okay to start off with this......but I would still suggest playing Kingdom Hearts 1 & 2 as well as 3D.......and I hope 3 will be good.

The Mark of Mastery comes with 5 3D AR Cards, like the Limited Edition $40 game at WalMart.......but you also get 12 artwork stuff & a great Kingdom Hearts 10th Anniversary 3DS case, which goes great with such 3DS colors as Red & Purple & maybe also White......but I have Blue and it doesn't look that good in bright areas, buti still love wearing it on my 3DS 24/7 anyways.

So besides Heartless & Nobodies, there is also just a walking Heart, as well as ISO's & Spirits & Nightmares & Dream Eaters & Reapers.

Basically, they are clearly making a sequel for the World Ends With You, for the 3DS.

Like Kingdom Hearts 1 & 2......3D is also a main game.

Quite frankly, I now don't know how I will play this game without Flowmotion & Reality Shift & Dual Links in the upcoming Kingdom Hearts 3........so I guess you could say that this game has ruin me, LOL.

This is a must have game, no matter what kind of gamer you are.

And everything gets revealed in this game, which makes me question the upcoming 3, but 3D does leave some things for you to want to see in the last game.

And they now sell this game by itself for $30 at places like GameStop and probably also on amazon, and so fort.

And you are really going to change your mind about hating 3D after you play this entire game with the 3D ON & all the way UP.

This game is simply so beatiful in every way, I don't know how else to describe it with the 3D all the way up, without you seeing it for yourself.

Even though both HD & Monchromatic 3D are just passing fads that are going to die forever finally.

But both IMAX & Stereoscopic 3D are here forever since they first arrived, and the 3DS is Stereoscopic 3D, and like all Stereoscopic Movies, it's 60 fps per video image.

So enjoy the great Stereoscopic 3D 60 fps per eye in-sinc experience.

Oh yeah, and the 6 to 7 speaker sound the 3DS does thru the Earphone Jack is just Wonderful in Kingdom Hearts 3D, but I have heard better Surround Sound in a few other games, i.e. Zelda Ocarina of Time 3D (Best Surround Sound EVER) & Thor 3DS (Second best Surround Sound) & Dillon's Rolling Western (best Surround Sound for a Digital Only game)

Also Kingdom Hearts 3D is getting a Digital release in the eShop to download onto your 3DS instead, if you can wait up to around 3 months or 6.

FYI I use ""PLANTRONICS GAMECOM 777"" for my Surround Sound gaming and I just leave the separate Microphone jack plug unplugged, because I am only using the 7.1 Surround Sound Earphone functionality......plus the 3DS already has a Built-in surround sound microphone to pick up sound in beatiful 6 or 7 speaker sound, like in 3D Video Recording.

If you want other Steroscopic 3D Surround Sound game suggestions:

Kid Icarus: Uprising

King of Pirates

Rodea the Sky Soldier

Dillon's Rolling Western

Rhythm Thief and the Emperor's Treasure

Nano Assault EX

Mario Kart 7

Ketzal's Corridors

Mutant Mudds (3DS, it has 40 extra levels the PC will never have)

Pushmo

Cave Story 3D (the Surround Sound is limited in a side-scroller, so you can just use the Speakerphones, which in the 3DS does Virtual Surround Sound, because its just mere Speakerphones).

Sonic & All Stars Racing Transformed (3DS)

Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon

Lego City Undercover (3DS)

Tales of the Abyss 3DS

Lego Batman 2 (3DS) (but same old Lego gameplay)

Super Smash Bros. 3DS

Resident Evil: Revelations

Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater

Their systems are reasonably priced, feature great sound and graphics, and are lots of fun ! The thing about a portable gaming system is keeping all of the bits and pieces together. The early Nintendo handheld were simply game and cartridge. The newer systems have added a stylus and the ability to charge on the go. All of this stuff needs a place, both at home and as you travel. Enter this great carrier.

The outer shell is a rugged yet lightweight material. It holds the game unit, cartridges, and accessories firmly while providing easy access at the same time. An outer pocket is held shut with velcro, while the console and cartridges get a nice beefy zipper for two separate sections. There's also a sturdy handle to grab or loop through a belt. It would have been nice to include a dedicated belt loop, but its certainly not a deal breaker that they skipped it.

The side that keeps the DS also has several loops to carry a stylus or four and a charger for the wall or the car. There's a velcro strap to secure the console and the lining for this pouch is soft so that it won't scratch up your Nintendo portable. The carrier is marketed for the new 3DS, but it could just as easily work with the Lite or the DSi.

The back pocket of the carrier is straight up nylon with stretch pockets to hold games. Both the regular DS games and the new notched 3DS games fit snugly in the pouches. There's a total of 12 slots, so being limited to your top three isn't a problem for the next road trip. At the end of the day, this carrier is a real bargain and a great value. The need for a good carrier is important, especially if you were one of the lucky few who got to spend more than $200 on the new 3DS. Better protect that investment, right ?

Another aspect is the fact that Spider-man interacts with a ton of other marvel super heroes throughout the game including: Luke Cage, Moon Knight, Black Cat, and Wolverine.  The newest and by are the coolest aspect of Shadows is the fighting system.  It is extremely fluid.  Too fluid, as in ""I have never seen combos like this in a game before.""  Awesome.

Another point of the game includes the ability to go from the red to the black suit anytime you want along with making ""Good"" and ""Dark"" decisions that affect how the story will unfold.

I considered purchasing an Xbox One controller, but the total cost for one of those is $85~ before tax & shipping (3 purchases: controller + wireless receiver + cheapest charge pack).

I personally don't think there's much of a difference between the 360 controller and the Xbox One controller. If that cost included an Xbox One Elite controller (or even for slightly more but with all the necessary components) then it might justify the price difference, but that's not the case.

According to the reviews some people are having issues connecting this item and getting it to work properly. I haven't had any issues. Be advised though, I did not use the CD-ROM disc that came with it.

For those having issues:
1) I found it quicker to simply go into the control panel and locate the ""unknown"" device to update the drivers manually.
2) You can easily verify it's the correct device before applying the drivers by looking at the port location of the hardware or even by just disconnecting the USB plug and watching it disappear. Reconnect it once you've verified it.
3) The best part about this receiver is that the drivers are already built in to Windows because it's a Microsoft Product. Click update driver and choose to browse by device then scroll all the way down to Xbox 360 peripherals & select Xbox 360 wireless receiver. Boom! You're connected.
4) The only thing left is to pair your Xbox 360 controller and the newly installed wireless receiver just as you would pair it to an Xbox 360 the first time in order to connect.",This product works beautifully.

Naval battles... a blast...wait until you disable a man o' war (by sheer luck) so early in the game, and board it... I don't think I have ever experienced this kind of excitement in a game

Kenway's fleet.. Now this is a very very interesting addition to the game and with a bit more polishing it can turn into something really good

Fort siege.. fun fun fun, the last one I took was at night in horrible storm, and having to dodge cannonballs, mortar fire, huge waves and tornadoes.. yes TORNADOES was just epic.

Shark / Whale hunting..(little spoiler ahead) playing in the dark with some decent sound and having a shark or orca rushing at you after breaking the line made my eyes pop and got me into a straight position in my couch (I almost jumped)  >.>

58402,5.0,True,"01 13, 2013",AI7WXHDA2OJXH,B0002GTFIK,Quercus Alba,"Wow, this was a HUGE game.  I finished Star Ocean Till The End of Time in 228 hours, over a few months.  Overall, I would call this a classic, epic Japanese Role-Playing Game (JRPG), with a great story, great characters, and an amazingly large level of detail in things like item creation, size of dungeons, weapons/items/monsters... this game is big and deep in all areas.

Although the theme is somewhat outer space sci-fi, there is a significant portion of the game played on primative worlds, and the use of swords, armor, magic, etc., like we are used to in many RPG's is the predominant theme here.  If you are a big fan of Final Fantasy games, you will feel pretty ""at home"" here.  The story, without giving it away, is ingenious and will have you thinking.

I loved the characters.  You eventually fill out your party with 8 characters.  You can use 3 characters at a time in fights, and between fights you can freely change your order by substituting.  Of your 8 characters, 6 are fairly automatic, and you choose the last 2 permanent members from 4 alternates.  This is good, because it allowed me to avoid having the two characters I disliked most in my permanent party, and it allowed me to keep my favorite character, Nel, permanently.  The voice acting for the characters is among the best I have ever heard on an RPG.  In particular, Nel, Fayt, and Cliff are suberbly done.  The voice acting for Nel is the best I've ever heard in a game.  The 8 characters include ""tanks"", spell-users, thief types, etc.

There are lots of dungeons, lots of dungeon levels, and lots of monsters.  You will do a lot of fighting in this game.  The battle system is good.  It is real-time battle, and you can alternate the view setting between an active, moving camera perspective and a solid, stationary battlefield (I preferred the latter).  Like many JRPG's, combat is deep in detail and complexity, and heavy with flashy magic flashes and animation, but without the blood and gore you find on more Western-style RPG's.  Although the characters are drawn anime-style, I got used to that quickly and it was not distracting.

This game involved some grinding for levels and for treasure.  A lot of grinding, in fact.  I enjoyed it, but if that is not your thing, you might not enjoy it so much.  The leveling advancement is fun, but it is also necessary to be ready for later stages of the game.  Grinding is also necessary to acquire the gold needed for item creation.

Item creation is a huge part of the game.  You recruit and ""sign"" inventors, then create your own items and weapons in workshops around the world.  I found the item creation in this game to be complex and time-intensive.  It is rewarding when successful, and it becomes necessary enough that you can't really avoid it.  It is a time sap, though.  It gets somewhat fun when you get the hang of it, but wow, I did spend some significant time in the workshops.  This aspect is probably most appealing to those who like deeper games and more complexity.  If you prefer to tear through a game as fast as possible, the item creation will drive you batty.  I had already bought the BradyGames Guide for this game, and through the item creation alone, I did so much page-flipping, I ended up wearing out the binding and putting the pages in a three-ring binder.  The guide is recommended, although I'm sure there are online guides available that will work too.  This is a complex, deep game.

The graphics, cut-scenes, and music are all very good.  Again, the voice acting and characters are excellent.

If you are a fan of JRPG's, this is an epic classic that is not to be missed.  I am very happy that I played it, it is one of my favorite games.  4.5 stars - a great game.","Huge, memorable, great JRPG",1358035200,,,

At the time, I paid $45.00 for a used copy, which even then was expensive. To this day, the price hasn't gone down any, but I can assure you that, for any Zelda fan, the price is well worth the enjoyment you'll get out of it.

As the box says, this disc has 4 full games on it. It also has a demo of The Wind Waker, a short video retrospective, and a fairly useless tutorial about hoking up a Game Boy Advance to The Wind Waker (kind of irrelevant if the person doesn't own the full game).

The first game included is The Legend of Zelda, from the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). This game is the one most people remember, and considering the time when it was made, it holds up fairly well. If anything, it's actually slightly overrated in my opinion, but it's still a very good game.

The second title is Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, also on the NES. While many people don't seem to like this one, it actually is my favorite of the ""old"" Zelda games. Unlike the first game, even aimlessly wandering around has a purpose, as you gain experience points, grow stronger and learn spells in a very RPG-like fashion. The side-scrolling view also helps make it more action-oriented.

The third game included on this disc, Ocarina of Time, is undoubtedly a classic. The graphics actually look a bit sharper here than on the native Nintendo 64 hardware, and the inherent control differences inherent in the system (familiar to anyone who's worked with an emulator or the Virtual Console) aren't as big an issue here as some games. Another good feature is that the GameCube controller has rumble built into it.

The fourth game is Majora's Mask. Similarly to Zelda II, I actually like this one better than Ocarina of Time, if only because it's so different. Unfortunately, there are occasional sound glitches (which the manual and load screen list as due to the porting process), but these don't detract from enjoyment of the game.

Just as the game says, with this disc and the Game Boy Player, it is possible to play every entry in the Zelda series on the GameCube (except for Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, Skyward Sword, and Link's Crossbow Training). The games are:

- The Legend of Zelda (this disc / Game Boy Advance)
- Zelda II: The Adventure of Link (this disc / Game Boy Advance)
- A Link to the Past (Game Boy Advance)
- Link's Awakening (Game Boy / Game Boy Color)
- Ocarina of Time (this disc / Master Quest)
- Majora's Mask (this disc)
- Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages (Game Boy Color)
- Four Swords (Game Boy Advance)
- The Wind Waker (GameCube)
- Four Swords Adventures (GameCube)
- The Minish Cap (Game Boy Advance)
- Twilight Princess (GameCube)

With a good gaming rig, it looks and runs amazingly good, the cars and guns handle very well, and the hoverjet and bike are a blast to fly.  Overall the story is solid, all of the voice acting is top notch, and it leaves you wanting more.  The clothing  customization options on your character are not as extensive as SR2, but there is still quite a bit you can do with your toons.  And the facial rendering is miles ahead of SR2.

The infamous adult oriented melee weapon is a good hint at the kind of topics that come up, but is by no means the most adult oriented joke in the game.  It is a mature rated game, and rightly so.

The program begins with Maya greeting you and giving you a fitness assessment. Here you will input your height, weight and activity level and you will do a series of exercises; crunches, sit-ups, push-ups, and jumping jacks. Then you check your heart rate and input the information. Based on your level of fitness Maya will recommend an exercise program for you. She will tell you what you need to do and how many days a week you need to do it, to help you achieve your goals.

Maya will give you a selection of spaces to exercise in and ask what equipment you have. If you own a stepper, stability ball, weights and heart rate monitor, she will incorporate these into the workout. I would highly recommend adding all the equipment - especially the weights and heart rate monitor as these can really help you achieve your fitness goals.

After selecting your space (different virtual rooms with a different feel to each one) Maya begins your personalized program. During the workout she will ask you how you are feeling or you can at any time increase or decrease the intensity of the workout. At the bottom of the screen a scroll tells you what is coming up next in the workout ie squats, sidesteps, a stepper etc. You can also change the music selection - over 70 songs are available including hip hop, latin and 80's. The bottom also counts down the time of your workout - a fabulous feature.

Over time as you exercise, you will ""unlock"" treats from Maya like new workout spaces. Because she has so many ""moves"" your execise time with Maya will vary from one day to the next and keep your interest.

Maya also will hold you accountable. If you miss a day she will ask (nicely) where you were. As you exercise she will encourage you. Maya's voice is a beautiful, easy to listen to voice and you can lower or raise the volume of her voice and/or the music.
Maya herself is a buff looking brunette, it would have been nice if one could personalize their trainer's looks, and I will bet that's not to far down the road!

Maya also has a peaceful room where she will lead you in a nice yoga interlude. As you progress through the program Maya will help you adjust your goals and set new ones.

She will also set meal plans for you if desired.

I have to admit Maya has amazed me, besides kicking my booty in our exercise sessions. And the price point of $35 is so reasonable. Others love it too and there is an online community at [...] devoted to discussions on this program.

Highly recommended!

65978,5.0,True,"04 20, 2015",A1YBLPSMIYHF3U,B0009A4EV2,J. Butler,"I was first exposed to the Dragon Quest series by DQ IX on the Nintendo DS. Admittedly, that is a little late in the series to get acquainted, but I am glad I did. That little gem made my check out DQ VIII and I am glad I did.

Dragon Quest is your usual RPG in that you follow a quest chain, meet new characters along the way, fight in random battles, and defeat dungeons bosses all while gaining experience and gold along the way. Nothing too mind blowing yet. Where Dragon Quest VIII excels is the little things.

First off, you have Akira Toriyama on board per usual doing the character designs. It doesn't get better than that. He has been active in the manga biz for 35 years and was responsible for one of the most popular animes in America. His characters are extremely unique, while at the same time keeping with his style. Now to compliment the design of the characters, the game was rendered in like a cartoony fashion. Nothing photo realistic here, it looks like you are playing an anime, and that works really well. The colors are vibrant and the graphics don't look at all dated for a 10 year old PS2 game. Without trying to render crazy high polygon characters, the game games backgrounds look great and the game runs with few slow downs.

The combat is just the way I like it - old school turn based. None of this action RPG malarkey where everyone just runs about and does as they please. Turns are fair, calculated, and strategized. You need to be aware of type advantages and enemy weaknesses. After the battle you allocate you skill points into a weapon specialization: swords, maces, arrow, etc. After a handful of points you get a skill boost in the weapon class.

The audio department is another area where this game absolutely shines. The soundtrack is amazing and provides all sorts of themes and  background music throughout the game. Lots of really catchy stuff here. I'd even dare to say it rivals some of Final Fantasies best work. The voice acting is also done extremely well. Nothing seems forced or cringey, (unlike FFX), and every line of dialog is quite pleasant to hear.

The story is pretty simple. You follow a transfigured king and his daughter on a pilgrimage to capture a sorcerer who cursed them. Along the way you have side adventures in new towns and locations to spice things up. Not exactly the most robust motivation, but it works really well here.

My only complaint is barely even a complaint at all. The random battles are engaged with enemies even though you can't see them on the world map. This isn't exactly fair since this mechanic wasn't introduced until the next game, but it just makes me long for it when I play DQVIII. They have other roaming creatures out in the world, it would have been nice to see the monsters.

Overall, this game is very well made and extremely fun to play. I hope one day it gets remastered for the PS3 so I can see the details really pop. Until then, pick it up on PS2 for cheap and you can get the FFXII demo included. WOOO!",Square Enix Wins Again,1429488000,,,

413147,5.0,True,"03 9, 2017",A2RIY8NSZJNH41,B010NCWJXK,Chad,"Before this game, I had never played a Fire Emblem game at all. I do not know how it rates against others, but if you enjoy tactical RPGs, this is a good game. Perhaps not the most engaging characters in a video game, but they're not dull. I find a few of them to fall into standard Japanese video game tropes (and accidentally marrying my in-game cousin was awkward), however it's not all that bad. If I had any complaints, it's that in order to experience the Conquest story, I have to endure a harder difficulty or use Phoenix Mode (revives your characters mid-battle when your turn comes back up).

I do not have the tactical skills to survive Conquest without pulling my hair out. Call me a weirdo, but I like to have fun in my games more than I like a challenge.

Still, it's manageable, I'm sure. I would recommend this to beginners of not just Fire Emblem, but also to tactical RPGs in general. It's not too hard, but you have decent options for tuning your difficulty. You can choose ""Classic Mode"" so that any character that dies in the field stays dead (well, ""retired"" and you don't get to hear about what they do with their lives after the game ends) or you can choose the other mode(s) that lets you play without those consequences. On top of that is the separate option for difficulty (Classic isn't a difficulty, it's an accent to the difficulty). This is pretty standard. If you've played a video game before, you know what it is, I won't even bother clarifying.

All-in-all, very fun. I even bought a Robin amiibo for this game (it IS amiibo-compatible, if you're wondering. At the moment four Fire Emblem amiibos work for it, check online for compatibility) because I liked his design and figured he'd be fun to have on my team.

At your mystical castle, you click on the orb near your personal secretary (not much of a better word for what they do) and click the amiibo option to summon your amiibo character. After each battle you can do it again, with the third time offering a battle where you can recruit the character (after winning, not in-battle recruitment, that's different and can be harder, by the way) to your team.

It's a pretty cool little bonus and I wish more games I'm interested in had that kind of interactivity, but I can't complain all that much.

Anyway, to conclude my long-winded review, if the game looks interesting to you, check it out. I bought it because the gameplay looked decent and the idea of the marriage system (you can have children who will join your team) piqued my interest. Also the aesthetic of Birthright was pleasing to my eye, though I am just as in love with Conquest's (Nohr) after playing Fates.","Fun, tactical RPG with a fair emphasis on story.

Borderlands is all about pure cooperative chaos and it delivers in spades.  I played a ways through the single player, just taking it easy and learning the ropes.  It holds up well as a single player experience, but when you jump into the multiplayer mix, thats when Borderlands truly shines! The storyline is nothing to get excited about really, you are looking from some ancient vault with lots o items to plunder and you meet a host of goofy characters along the way but thats about it. However, Borderlands is not so much about the story as it is about questing with friends and collecting loot.

This is a first person shooter at its core with some light RPG elements.  You attack enemies and complete quests to gain experience points to gradually rise in level.  Borderlands sports a skill talent tree similiar to the one used in world of warcraft.  At level five you get one of 4 different action skills depending on which character class you choose and each level after that gives you one talent point to customize your avatar's skills.  As i said, there are 4 different characters to choose from, a brutish tank, a balanced soldier, a long range attacker, and a stealthy chick.  Each one plays a little different, my personal favorite being the berzerker.  Using his skill gives you increased damage resistance as well as augmented melee power so you can really get in the thick of it and pound some skags (they are these mutated coyotes looking things).  Everytime you enter the berzerker mode your character starts grunting and screaming like a mental patient which cracks me up everytime i do it.

There are weapon drops galore and each one is random, so no one will have the exact same guns you do, unless of course you have one of the many unique items that drop from boss characters or you receive from quest givers.  Im constantly surprised by the drops, at one point i picked up a regular looking shotgun and found out i could fire rockets from it, which was flippin sweet.  Borderlands has some basic vehicle support allowing you and a friend to mount up and drive or shoot depending on which chair you jump in.  Money and experience are shared among party members but ammo and weapon drops are fair game for whoever grabs them first which can really bring my piss to a boil when im out of ammo and everyone else snatches it up regardless of whether they need it or not, but when im feeling hostile towards another player i can challenge them to a duel and then enter berzerker mode to pound them into the ground while i grunt and spit my way to victory.

The graphics are unique to say the least, they make you feel like you have entered a comic book and im pleased that they changed the textures from the more realistic looking appearance they started with years ago, it just seems to fit well with the comical Borderlands vibe.

126997,5.0,True,"07 2, 2010",A1T9PJBFBFKSGD,B00104KJ42,Auburn Niewiadomski,"Indiana Jones is a fantastic franchise, Harrison Ford is an incredible actor and plays his scenes brilliantly, the action is exciting and directing this franchise is possibly the best director ever Steven Spielberg, but alas I'm a wimp and I can't stand the slightest bit of blood so I've never watched any of those films. So I was very excited when I found out there was going to be a LEGO version of the Indiana Jones franchise. It follows Indy in his first three adventures, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom, and the Last Crusade. The game play design is very similar to LEGO Star Wars design, and the typical LEGO humor is still there. Also this is a family friendly game, the LEGO villains just break apart after their killed nothing gruesome. Now this is not just a fighting game, you also have to solve puzzles and that's what makes this game terrific. Now for younger children I'd recommend purchasing a guide it can get frustrating at times, or maybe the parents can step in and solve the puzzle the kids stuck on.

There are three things to collect in each level, there is a gold stud meter on the top of your screen which becomes fuller and fuller each time you smash LEGO objects and collect their studs. These coins help you unlock cheats. You also can collect ten hidden treasures in each level. Last of all, in each level you can also collect one parcel and place it in the hidden mail box to be able to buy cheats. And it's not easy; I can tell you that, sometimes you really have to try certain things. I love challenges and this game gives me that element that so many games don't have. There are two play modes, story mode, where you watch LEGO sequences and play with the two selected characters chosen for the episode, and free play, where you can play as whoever you want. But it's not a useless mode, in fact many treasures and parcels can only be found with numerous characters. There's an army soldier with a bazooka gun, he can help you blow up an item that's impossible to break with a pistol. Some women can scream to break glass, Indy's whip can pick up certain items. There over sixty characters to unlock in all! And they all have different abilities. So as you can see, there's great replay value here. Now when you finish a level, you can decide to continue to the next chapter or go to the college, and let me tell you the college is so much fun. There are numerous rooms to choose from, and there's also a room where you can create your own character. There's tons of looks to choose from and it's a lot of fun too.

Now you may think the controls will be difficult but they're not. They're very simple and if you still are confused there is a pamphlet included that features many of the moves you can do throughout the game. And just like LEGO Star Wars there's a two player mode, and it's so much fun. But, your characters have to be close by or the screen will just stay still so younger kids might get frustrated if they want to go seperate ways, I'm just warning you parents. Also, you can join in and drop out any time you want. Did I mention the graphics? They're very impressive for a PlayStation 2 game, there almost as good as the PlayStation 3 version.

After you get 100% LEGO studs start falling all over the college and it's a nice way to show you have completed the game, it's just so much fun so if you haven't purchased LEGO Indiana Jones the Original Adventures yet, I'd recommend purchasing it very soon.

(Oh by the way, there are three secret levels in the college, but I'm not going to tell you how to find them, you'll have to figure out how to unlock them yourself.)

25296,5.0,False,"07 6, 2003",A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005N7YQ,Daniel Jolley,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a surprisingly fun game, one that Potter fans of any age can enjoy.  While the game can be challenging at certain points, it provides the kind of challenge that young children and those like myself (whose love for gaming is exceeded only by their general ineptitude at successfully solving and finishing them) can figure out on their own.  In a couple of cases, a degree of logic must be employed that the youngest of players might not catch on to very quickly, but every thing in this game is solvable and, even better, provides a certain sense of accomplishment when you figure out how to get by a tricky obstacle.  The graphics aren't spectacularly impressive for the most part, but the look and feel of the game works well in this environment and does capture a sense of the Hogwarts essence.  Sure, it would be nice if the pictures on the walls of Hogwarts moved, but there are better things to do with computer memory than this.
Naturally, you assume the role of Harry Potter.  Having arrived at Hogwarts, you must attend classes and learn different types of spells that will become essential over the course of the game; each class leads quickly to a course designed to test your use of the spell you have just learned.  You must make things flip over or open, open magically locked doors, subdue dangerous plants, etc.  Along the way, you meet up with all of your Hogwarts favorites - Dumbledore (who for some odd reason first appears wearing a set of garish glasses apparently obtained from the 1970s Elton John vintage collection), Ron, Hermione, Quirrel, Sprout, Hagrid, Snape, Filch and Mrs. Norris, etc.  Fred and George are there to help you get your bearings and to provide you with the beginnings of your wizard card collection.
While the game is quite solvable, I completed several challenges only after many, many attempts.  The encounters with Draco Malfoy, trying to get back Neville's Remembrall and battling it out with wizard crackers, are tough at first.  I thought I would never get past the scene with the troll (partly because, for this one challenge only, your point of reference is the opposite of what you have grown accustomed to).  The final battle with You-know-who is also pretty tough to complete, but nothing required more time, trial, and error than trying to catch the Golden Snitch during two Quidditch matches and snaring the flying key during the approach to the final encounter.  The Quidditch matches are quite something to behold and can be quite fun, but one failed attempt after another at catching the Snitch can prove increasingly frustrating.
One drawback to this game comes from the fact that you basically know what is going to happen at the end; after all, the game follows the script of the book rather closely in a general sense.  I would also like to have seen more scenes animated; certain events at the beginning and end, such as the big events in the Grand Hall, are narrated in storyboard fashion.  My final small gripe concerns the cut scenes; often, when you perish and restart a challenge, you are forced to sit through the animated cut scene each and every time; when you require many attempts to complete a challenge, as I did, having to sit through these cut scenes time in and time out proves increasingly annoying.  All in all, though, my criticisms detract very little from a wonderfully enjoyable game presented in the true spirit of Harry Potter and his Hogwarts environment.  Even when you complete the game, there will most likely be a number of secrets left for you to discover in a brand new game.",More fun than a dungbomb in Snapes' office,1057449600,2,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

  There were also items and upgrades to collect that kinda helped bring back that original collection feeling that the first 3 Spyro games had (to an extent though).  By far the game play was the best in this game and having access to 8 different breathe abilities between Spyro and Cynder with 3 unique upgrades and functions for each of them.  This kept the game interesting for me just watching my breathe abilities as they grew more powerful with each upgrade.  It was nice to be able to play as Cynder and Spyro.  I'll have to do the multiplayer sometime with my friends since Ive only played as single player so far.  Also you can fly in this game!!!!!!  Well for the most part.  The free flying is limited and restricts you to a certain height so you don't get to fly everywhere at the height you would prefer, but it was still fun.  Overall this game made for a good ending to the trilogy and helped make the games memorable for me even if the previous games could of been better.",Best Game in the Trilogy for Me!!!!,1449273600,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

It works great playing Amazing Frog! via Steam on my Windows 10 PC's and the drivers loaded quickly and automatically (no reboots required). It comes with a 10 foot USB to micro USB cable (the controller connects via the micro USB port at the top of the controller). The cable connects snugly and is more than long enough to accommodate most setups (including having a projector and laptop on the table and then reaching players seated on the floor in front of the table...which is how we were using it today...not exactly typical, but it does illustrate just how far the cable reaches).

Using it on the XBOX One is (as expected) even more straightforward. I didn't experience any issues playing Fallout 4 and the analog sticks in particular feel very nice (not too stiff, but enough resistance and quick self-centering to make the only motions the ones I intend to make). The built in programmable multi-function control wheels are a nice addition, and aren't too terribly difficult to set-up (despite the vague instructions on the subject), but I haven't found a really good use for them in my console gaming. They may prove a lot more useful with PC games (where having shortcuts to oft-used keyboard controls could be a godsend for some games), but either way, it's a nice feature to have available, but doesn't get in the way of the basic functionality of the controller.

The Titanfall 2 motif is nice for the fans, and it's a good-looking controller. It's obviously built well and feels solid in the hands. None of the buttons on mine seem to stick or be too ""clicky."" It does have a 3.5mm jack to connect any typically-compatible headset. I don't do much online gaming these days, but for those who do, it's a must-have feature. All-in-all, if you're wanting a basic, solid, responsive wired controller with some useful bells and whistles that don't get in the way of basic functionality, then this is a solid option (especially if you want to use in on both your PC and XBONE).",Well-built & responsive wired controller for the XBONE ONE & PC.The extra features don't get in the way of basic functionality.,1479513600,,,

Although a bit misleading, I thought you could switch over from PS3 to phone if you received a call. But, you have to turn off the bluetooth in order to switch the pairing. But that's not a big issue, I'm usually not on the phone when I'm playing a game.

Pairing the bluetooth to both the PS3 and my phone was no hassle at all. All I had to do was plug it into the PS3 for a first-time connection, and every time after that, all I had to do was power on the bluetooth while the PS3 was on, and it would connect within 15 seconds. For my phone, the pairing was even simpler. Just read the instruction manual and follow the directions and it's an easy set up.

As for sound quality, the chat is very clear on the PS3 as well as on the phone. As for the receiving end, I have not received any complaints. They have said that the chat is clear and the sound is not too loud nor too low. The dual-mic noise cancellation does work, as I have blasted music as well as talked, and the receiving end said that they could only slightly hear the music. Not sure how the technology works with that, but it was able to pick up my voice over background noises.

I have only had it for 2 weeks, but battery life is pretty good. It lasts about 12 hours before needing a charge. A full charge takes about 2.5 hours from the low battery status.

The earpiece also fits great on my ear, and you can attach it to either ear. It may feel a little loose depending on your ear.
The blue light is also a nice added touch of aesthetics, in my personal opinion.

Lastly, I love how you can also put the bluetooth on the charging dock and still be able to use for the PS3. It works as a standing mic while charging at the same time.

The price of $49.99 is a bit high, however. But, just wait for a sale and get it for around $30-$40.",Great!,1360022400,,"{'Size:': ' .!Only Bluetooth 2.0', 'Color:': ' Blue'}",

The graphics are superb.
The puzzles are challenging (but logical, for the most part). Just as in Schizm, some involve alternative number bases. Unlike real stinkers, like Rhem, the clues are typically local to the puzzles, or the puzzles themselves are self-consistent; you don't have to wander all over the place looking for clues.
Schizm's weakest point - the live action - has been replaced by computer generated characters, and professional voiceover actors. It's a great improvement.
Chameleon has full motion, using the conventional combination of mouse and keyboard. This is somewhat of a mixed blessing; there is a definite risk of motion sickness if you're watching someone else play, particularly if you have a large monitor.
Be warned; the game makes significant demands on your system. Frame rates can be quite low in some of the scenes. You may have to reduce resolution to cope with this.

I was honestly really hesitant to purchase this initially as it seemed marketing to an older age range and even adults, and I know this series is quite popular with adults, but this game is really like Halo Lite!
It's a fun game with all the characters your kids will want to get to know and follow, but it lacks the extreme violence other games so often have. Yes, there is a ton of shooting, and yes, there is creature violence, but it doesn't resort to gore to sell the story.
As a parent who is not too thrilled with the extreme level of violence and graphic gore in video games today this was really a relief.

If you don't mind a first person shooter game for a young adult, but want to bypass all the extreme scenes that usually come with that this is a good game to get you there.
Additionally, the scenery is actually really mesmerizingly beautiful. The world this story exists in is surreal and truly otherworldly and I can appreciate it on that level as well!
The play seems a bit more simplistic than some of the other Halo series games, but I think this is a good introductory level game for kids.

When I bought Grip-iT Analog Covers I bought them primarily out of curiosity due to the positive reviews I've seen on the product page. I was not disappointed! First I covered the thumb-sticks on my Xbox 360 controller. Xbox 360 controller Thumb-Sticks are great by themselves, and mine were not damaged or anything like that. I thought I'd give it a try. To my surprise controlling the games did get better. That is due to two reasons. First the area in touch with the thumb becomes wider, which gives more leeway if you move your thumb around on the thumb stick. Second the material the grip covers are made from is a very nice textured rubber that really does give a feeling of ""good grip"". Finaly, it makes the thumb stick slightly higher than the thumb-stick without anything on. It maybe about a quarter of an inch, but it makes a big difference when you're aiming in shooter games. When the thumb stick is taller the distance you have to move the stick to make the camera or character move is greater, thus offering more precision. I was surprised when a 1/4 of an inch made a difference, but it did.

I also tried the same pair of grips on my PlayStation 3 Dual Shock 3 controller. Since players always complained about the PlayStation thumb-sticks the effect is even more dramatic. DualShock3 sticks are shaped like a mushroom with the center being elevated, as opposed to Xbox controller, where the center is pushed in or concave. This causes some players, including myself, to slip their thumbs accidentally, especially in shooter games. With the Grip-It covers on, the finger does not slip anymore and the surface becomes kind of flat instead of mushroom shaped. This makes playing games on PS3 more fun.

So, I highly recommend you try these Grip-It thumbstick covers. For $5 you cannot go wrong.",Absolutely Excellent Product,1322092800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

While it is true that this is *mostly* a port of the fantastic platformer from a couple years back, there are definitely enough additions and differences to make this a game that may be the preferred version among fans. Seeing how this is a game that has, for the most part, been accessible since 2010, I'll focus mainly on discussing the differences between this version and the original and whether or not you'll want to even bother buying this. Before I say anything else, now that for $20 (and don't ever pay more for a Nintendo Select title), this is a must-own game for your 3DS collection.

In the rare case that you're not familiar with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Donkey-Kong-Country-Returns/dp/B003ZHMMEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a>, I'll sum the game up thusly: It is easily one of the best Wii games, arguably the best Donkey Kong game that has ever been released, and it's a real contender for best 2-D platformer of the past two decades. It is that good. The whole experience is just saturated with nostalgia while still feeling extremely fresh. The visuals are colorful and stylistic, and the music is wonderful, whether the tune is classic or new. The level design and game mechanics are amazingly well-crafted, the difficulty and satisfaction in the game is huge, and most importantly, the control mechanics are so tight you can bounce a quarter off of the game and make change. Much like the original DKC trilogy, the gameplay has an awesome rhythmic quality to it. Yes, the game may be missing King K. Rool and the Kremlings as villains, and many of DK's relatives we've all come to know and love don't show up, but for the most part, Donkey Kong Country Returns really is the quintessential Donkey Kong game, and should not be missed. If you never got a change to play the original (god forbid), then this is a wonderful time to get into it, for certain.

So what are the main additions/differences between DKCR3D and the original? First off, the controls are obviously different. The Wii original used the motion-control capability of the Wiimote to good effect, in my opinion. I thought the waggle activated actions worked well for the most part, but it did have its issues that could really add frustration in intense platforming sections. I know of many people who hated that part of the original. For those who weren't so enthusiastic about the motion, you'll be happy to know that has all been replaced by traditional button presses, obviously. So basically, you will have a different experience when it comes to rolling, blowing, ground-pounding, etc. Otherwise, the super tight controls are the same.

There is a bit of extra content that has been added to the game this time around. After you beat the game, a whole new ""world"" of levels becomes accessible that are quite fun and unique to play through. Many of the settings of these new levels fit the themes found in the original world levels, but are brand new, such as one on a huge, low-leveled riverbed in a forest. They look and play great. The original had a ton of content, but these new additions are very nice indeed.

While DKCR is definitely a fun game, there's no doubt that it's also by far one of the most challenging platformers of the past decade or so. This definitely adds a huge level of satisfaction to the game, but it also stands as a huge barrier of entry to younger or less experienced gamers. For those people, Nintendo has added an ""easy mode"" of sorts to the game that greatly reduces the challenge. Some changes in this mode include DK and Diddy getting three hearts by default instead of two, power-ups that reduce damage, green balloons that save you if you were to fall into a bottomless pit, etc. To be honest, I'm torn on this. On one hand, I appreciate making a hard game more accessible so everyone can enjoy it. On the other hand, this ""easy mode"" makes the game almost insultingly easy by comparison. It's not too bad though, because ""original mode"" is still available, so if you crave the soul-crushing difficulty of the original, you can still play it that way, which is great.

Well, that's most of the major changes/additions you can expect from this game. I'm very impressed with the port-job the game received. Very little was sacrificed to get the game to play on Nintendo's handheld. You'll notice some details in the visuals are a bit toned down. After all, the 3DS isn't quite up to the Wii's specs, but it does still look great for the most part. DKCR is a splendidly detailed game, and it's worth noting that having all that shrunk to the 3DS(XL)'s screen size can get crowded at times. The cool 3-D effect, while nonessential for the gameplay itself, is really enjoyable to look at. Some portions of the game, such as the special silhouette levels, look really awesome in 3-D. The only problem I have with 3-D is that when action is heavy, sometimes the frame rate stutters ever-so-slightly, which can be a problem in a precision platformer like this. It's also worth noting that, while the original DKCR ran in 60 fps on the Wii, this version has been toned down to 30 fps, again, due to the difference in tech. While this is a shame, it really doesn't affect what a good time you'll be having. It still plays fantastic. Overall, Monster Games, the developer who did most of the work porting this game (they also made&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pilotwings-Resort/dp/B002I08VDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pilotwings Resort</a>), did a pretty fantastic job.

So, whether you played the original DKCR and salivate at the idea of it being portable, having extra content, and a new control scheme, or you're a newbie who has never even touched the game before, I'd say Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D is definitely a game you'll want to buy. I understand veterans of the original may not want to dish out the cash to play the game again, even with the aforementioned additions, but I did, and I'm glad I did. DKCR was the game that proved Retros Studios was a top-tier developer whose genius in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Metroid-Prime-Trilogy/dp/B002ATY7JE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Metroid Prime Trilogy</a>&nbsp;was not luck or a one-off success (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/and-it-appears-Retro-isn-t-quite-done-making-DK-games-Can-t-wait-for-DK-Tropical-Freeze-it-looks-amazing-already/dp/B00DC7O77A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">and it appears Retro isn't quite done making DK games. Can't wait for DK Tropical Freeze, it looks amazing already!</a>). They really hit this one out of the park. Personally, I can only think of a few ""flatformers"" that I enjoyed as much or more than I did with DKCR, and now I can enjoy it again on the go with this 3DS version. It's a fantastic game that simply should not be missed if you consider yourself a fan of Nintendo, DK, platformers, or just plain awesome games in general.

Well, they hyped up the online mode alot, not that it's a dud but it's actually fun to ply. Single player is much better than expected in online mode, but the bad thing is there's no online headset chat compatability, and no records of the opponent you're facing. It basically you going into as room and challenging annonymous people, while you're annonymous yourself.

If you were looking forward to the Create a PPV mode, it's not like you actually get to detail the arena and stuff, it's just you summing up an eigth card battle, chosing your arena, and announce team. So now you can create the most memroble matches.

Create a Belt will take long to custom since you need to get money by preforming additional tasks in both season and challenge mode.

The voice overs was a bit shbby, not that it was bad, but some characters were really off, and others managed to get there act together, e.g. Triple H, Eddie Gurrero and Vince McMahon.

The commentary is up to date but can continually be repeated, even in season mode, as now for the first time, it's found throughout the game.

A lot of times you really want to try out a certain game but can't because that would mean buying a whole new system and hope that system will offer steady support over its lifespan. With the PSP, it's one of those systems where the games that definately intrigue are on a new system so it becomes a question of ""can I live without buying a PSP?"" or decide to give up and get one anyway. Well I got a little impatient and had to check out those games so I thought I'd get it. So how does the system fare?

The system itself can be described as basically a miniature PS2. While graphically the PSP isn't as pristine, many of its games such as Crisis Core and God of War look pretty uncanny to their more bigger console brothers while we also have games such as Jeanne D'Arc, Final Fantasy Tactics or the Metal Gear Solid Digital Novel have great art design and going for a more storybook or unique quality than ultra-realism. The 16:9 ratio of the screen also helps give the games a more cinematic feel and the clarity in many of the games is quite striking. My one complaint and it's more for lack of gear or storage than anything but with the screen as widely accessible to rough surfaces and objects it can get easy to scratch unlike the DS which closes and shelters the screens so either hide the machine or put it where things aren't going to scratch across it.

The controls for a handheld game tend to be quite crucial and one thing that annoyed me with the machine was that my hands would cramp after awhile and after awhile would have to wave my hand back and forth like I burned it just to ""loosen it up"". Another small flaw I found was the buttons since in the heat of battle/excitement/whatever, it's easy to hit another button such as the ""Home"" which is right next to the analog nub (which feels awkward too) and it's easy for your palm to rub against the Power switch on the right to turn it off.

The PSP allows for a bit more than gameplay such as photos, music (which comes in handy for stuff like Grand Theft Auto where you can have custom radio stations with your own stuff), Wi-Fi and online gaming as well as the UMD movies which is a neat idea - watch movies in the backseat on long trips, say - but I kind of prefer the bigger theatricality of the HD widescreen TV and big volume stereo. Most won't even use the features and are perfectly content with having prints of photos set up, music on CD's or iPod's but the online gaming and Ad-Hoc feature can be quite welcome.

As for its library of games, it ultimately depends on your preference. There's racing like Wipeout and Midnight Club, platformers like Ratchet and Clank and Daxter, Silent Hill Origins for those into scary stuff, tactical RPG's like Tactics or Disgaea and long RPG's like Valkyrie Profile. There's even some unique games like Lumines, a puzzle game and PSP's version of Meteos, to Patapon which is basically a mixture of DDR and that electronic board game Simon Says. But for some gamers, actually finding the games can be another matter entirely since there's a good 5 games on my list that I'd love to play yet with 5 stores in town that sell PSP games, not a single store carries it.

I'd recommend the PSP for the kind of games it gets and owning a DS at the same time, I can get the more unique style and the traditional whenever I want.",On-the-go gaming fun,1207267200,,,

For most gamers they are one or the other.  Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance however is a first, in what I mean is that it is both a button masher and a stradgy style.  Let me explain.
Each Kombatant has 3 styles, two martial arts and one weapon.  Unlike #4 you don't lose your weapon when hit, and they don't do extreme amounts of damage when used.  However like the two styles they can be used to string comboes together.  However on the same token it is not neccesary to learn stradegy to beat story mode (it can help but not neccesary).
The story revolves around Shang Tsung and Quan Chi teaming up to take over both earthrealm and OUtworld.  After Vanquishing the two realms greatest champions (Shao Kahn and Lui Kang) they set forth a series of events to conquer the two relms.  Raiden relinqueshes his status as elder god to take on this force.  He allies himself with Kung Lao, Sub-Zero and his apprentice Frost, Sonya, Jax, and Johney Cage.  They then set forth to take out Quan Chi and Shang Tsung.  Also in the mix are the returning Scorpion, Kitana, Kano, and Cyrax.  The new characters are very diversed as well, from Bo Rai Cho and his prefered style of Drunken Fighting, to Mei Li who wants to rescue her clan, to Kenshi the blind warrior out to slay Shang Tsung, to Drahmin an Oni from the Netherrelm.
The one thing that did not change (besides the awsome Fatalities) is the fact that the sub boss (past guys were Goro, Kintaro, and Motaro) is the creature called Molock.  Molock has no specific skills, little fighting moves, but is very fast, relelntless, blocks a lot, and is powerful.  This makes for a very frustrating battle with some characters.  However with others it is a cake walk (well sort of).
Overall this is the best fighting game out there for the average gamer.

Almost all of the cars sound identical when you start making any modifications and even in stock trim most of the cars sound the exact same.

I bought this Limited Edition because I wanted the book and the instant downloads, but if you have patience and can wait until the car packs start coming you will be find ordering the stock edition.",Such An Improvement,1318550400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

185516,5.0,True,"10 11, 2010",A1NQ2AY8S778X8,B001TOMQVC,Nerrel,"like 90% of wii owners, i passed on this game the moment i heard it was a rail shooter. no matter how good it may be, $50 is just too much to spend on a halfhearted cash-in that will last you for 6 hours of repetitive blasting, right? well, like 90% of wii owners, i was wrong.

the first thing that needs to be known is that this is not a conventional rail shooter like house of the dead the resident evil chronicles, but more of a genre defying shooter like sin and punishment. the gameplay features unique twists that deepen the strategy beyond just shooting everything that moves, giving you an arsenal of mostly impractical weapons and enemies that can't be killed with straightforward shots; you'll have to target an enemy's narrow, flailing limbs in order to take them out, which becomes a tense challenge when the screen is full of charging monsters. luckily, your controls are up to the task with a wiimote scheme that matches metroid corruption and resident evil 4 in demonstrating the obvious superiority of IR aiming.

the game makes heavy use of story and exploits the on rails gameplay to set up cutscenes that wouldn't work in-game otherwise, controlling the camera so that all the sights eurocom want you to see effortlessly unfold before your eyes. the camera pans so naturally during gameplay that you often forget the game is on rails at all, feeling comfortably under your control without any player input needed. the production values are amazing, with far above average acting, great art direction, stunning graphics, and an orchestrated score that easily bests the ones heard in most actual films. from the first few minutes alone, it's clear that extraction isn't another halfhearted attempt to capture the wii audience without making a full game; it's something special all on it's own, and in my opinion ranks beyond metal gear in pulling off convincingly cinematic gameplay.

the game's 10 chapters will take you through a gruesome and compelling story that clocks in around 7 to 8 hours total; if that doesn't sound like much, it's important to stress that it's quality and not quantity that matters most and extraction packs enough into those few hours to satisfy once the game is done. outside of the story, there's a challenge mode that places you in one of 10 different locales from the game against hordes of necromorphs to try for a high score, although shooting waves of the same enemies gets a little redundant early on.
there are a few incentives to replay the single player missions such as finding missed upgrades or data files, but the main replay value is the great gameplay itself, which will more than likely pull you in more than once. my only complaint is that due to the real time nature of all the cinema scenes, none of them can be skipped the second time through, but when they're this well done it could be worse.

extraction is one of the few examples of an effort on the part of a 3rd party developer to make something truly great on the wii, and at it's current price there's no excuse for any wii owner to pass it up anymore. not only do eurocom deserve the sale, but you owe it to yourself as a wii owner to play one of the very best the system has to offer.",phenomenal shooter,1286755200,,,

It has a world of everything mario that fans will enjoy. It has a unique battle system that made timing a key to winning. You must use strategy in your fights and make sure that you have sufficient help to get through the battles. You must also master the moves of the friends that Mario gains along his journey. This game is not just for kids, the paper look takes away the ""fuzzy"" look that most 3D N64 games have. It does have bright levels, but i liked it and it made me kind of happy.

Pros: 1. It has a lot of room to store not only a 3DS XL but more you can place your favorite earpods/earphone, a power bank with a charger and some spare cable with a stylus pen  if needed, which I find better than other off brand cases. the thing store my 6.1 inch phone in there

2. The build quality is amazing not saying its made of steel which would be cool ...but???? maybe not an good idea... now anyway this thing holds up darn well after I (accidentally drop it out my window)  ;) which is two stores high with my power bank and smartphone inside.  Not saying you should do that, I only do this kind of test for my future channel I trying to work on besides I like to push this budget kind of things to see if you can get more than your money worth, overall it's pretty darn hard on ( no puns intended)

3. It can store up to 8 cartridges for on the go, which I use for my sd card for my many devices. that's a bonus for me maybe for you too

Con: 1. Color options, not every one goes for the black look people like more options like they could throw in a Red, blue , orange, gold, silver, heck even green maybe  be good. Its for the 3ds xl overall you know you got some big Pokemon fans that want something to match up with their gear

All I'm saying I feel good buying this for the price and if your not ify about the color options go for it, its more worth than what your paying for (if they don't jack up the price after this review)","It has a lot of room to store not only a 3DS XL but more you can place your favorite earpods/earphone, a power bank with a charg",1478908800,,{'Color:': ' Black&Red'},"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81JzrexQlhL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Q7GwUfDYL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xlCb9iFkL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81UGT+q5zIL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81pWCwmiMYL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EoCAjYwgL._SY88.jpg']"
