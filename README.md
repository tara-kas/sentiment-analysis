NLP sentiment analysis for marketing

project from Manning's live project: [Sentiment Analysis and Natural Language Processing for Marketing](https://www.manning.com/liveproject/sentiment-analysis-and-natural-language-processing-for-marketing) alongside this [helpful guide](https://github.com/koosha-t/Sentiment-Analysis-NLP-for-Marketting).

brief: 
> In this liveProject, you’ll step into the role of a Natural Language Processing Specialist working in the Growth Hacking Team of a new video game startup. Your team wants to massively accelerate your company’s early growth by acquiring huge numbers of customers at the lowest possible cost. To help tailor marketing messages, your boss has asked you to map the market and find out how customers evaluate your competitors’ products. Your challenge is to create a sentiment analyzer that will give a deeper understanding of customer feedback and opinions. To do this, you’ll need to download and create a dataset from Amazon reviews, build an algorithm that will determine whether a review is positive or negative, evaluate your analyzer's performance against star ratings, and lay out your findings in a report for your manager.
