       "4  The game is incredibly limited. The graphics are pretty solid, there just isn't enough in the game to keep it interesting for more than a day or two. All of the weapons you grind to level up for have major drawbacks and you just end up going back to the guns you got early on. The game gets super boring super fast. I played for about 3 days and haven't touched it since. Total waste of money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

The graphics and sound are decent, but nothing you can't find in any number of graphic novels or games.

Maya is a virtual fitness \"person\" who will help you meet your fitness goals.\\n\\nThe program begins with Maya greeting you and giving you a fitness assessment. Here you will input your height, weight and activity level and you will do a series of exercises; crunches, sit-ups, push-ups, and jumping jacks. Then you check your heart rate and input the information. Based on your level of fitness Maya will recommend an exercise program for you. She will tell you what you need to do and how many days a week you need to do it, to help you achieve your goals.\\n\\nMaya will give you a selection of spaces to exercise in and ask what equipment you have. If you own a stepper, stability ball, weights and heart rate monitor, she will incorporate these into the workout. I would highly recommend adding all the equipment - especially the weights and heart rate monitor as these can really help you achieve your fitness goals.\\n\\nAfter selecting your space (different virtual rooms with a different feel to each one) Maya begins your personalized program. During the workout she will ask you how you are feeling or you can at any time increase or decrease the intensity of the workout. At the bottom of the screen a scroll tells you what is coming up next in the workout ie squats, sidesteps, a stepper etc. You can also change the music selection - over 70 songs are available including hip hop, latin and 80's. The bottom also counts down the time of your workout - a fabulous feature.\\n\\nOver time as you exercise, you will \"unlock\" treats from Maya like new workout spaces. Because she has so many \"moves\" your execise time with Maya will vary from one day to the next and keep your interest.\\n\\nMaya also will hold you accountable. If you miss a day she will ask (nicely) where you were. As you exercise she will encourage you. Maya's voice is a beautiful, easy to listen to voice and you can lower or raise the volume of her voice and/or the music.\\nMaya herself is a buff looking brunette, it would have been nice if one could personalize their trainer's looks, and I will bet that's not to far down the road!\\n\\nMaya also has a peaceful room where she will lead you in a nice yoga interlude. As you progress through the program Maya will help you adjust your goals and set new ones.\\n\\nShe will also set meal plans for you if desired.\\n\\nI have to admit Maya has amazed me, besides kicking my booty in our exercise sessions. And the price point of $35 is so reasonable. Others love it too and there is an online community at [...] devoted to discussions on this program.\\n\\nHighly recommended!\\n\\nUPDATE: I had a question about the program and was very pleased with the Yourself!

The lack of a proper joystick controller makes this game a *needs improvement*.\\nNot a big fan of games that actually remove game pad controller functionality to force one to use the keyboard.\\nyes, there's way of working around it, however why remove it to begin with ?\\n\\nI have placed this in the closet and will be taking a look at it when I'm finished playing all my other games that don't for to have to be looking constantly at the keyboard and missing the action that's on the BIG screen..   \n",

       "4362  From the minute I met Maya, my new personal trainer I was hooked. Maya is a virtual fitness \"person\" who will help you meet your fitness goals.\\n\\nThe program begins with Maya greeting you and giving you a fitness assessment. Here you will input your height, weight and activity level and you will do a series of exercises; crunches, sit-ups, push-ups, and jumping jacks. Then you check your heart rate and input the information. Based on your level of fitness Maya will recommend an exercise program for you. She will tell you what you need to do and how many days a week you need to do it, to help you achieve your goals.\\n\\nMaya will give you a selection of spaces to exercise in and ask what equipment you have. If you own a stepper, stability ball, weights and heart rate monitor, she will incorporate these into the workout. I would highly recommend adding all the equipment - especially the weights and heart rate monitor as these can really help you achieve your fitness goals.\\n\\nAfter selecting your space (different virtual rooms with a different feel to each one) Maya begins your personalized program. During the workout she will ask you how you are feeling or you can at any time increase or decrease the intensity of the workout. At the bottom of the screen a scroll tells you what is coming up next in the workout ie squats, sidesteps, a stepper etc. You can also change the music selection - over 70 songs are available including hip hop, latin and 80's. The bottom also counts down the time of your workout - a fabulous feature.\\n\\nOver time as you exercise, you will \"unlock\" treats from Maya like new workout spaces. Because she has so many \"moves\" your execise time with Maya will vary from one day to the next and keep your interest.\\n\\nMaya also will hold you accountable. If you miss a day she will ask (nicely) where you were. As you exercise she will encourage you. Maya's voice is a beautiful, easy to listen to voice and you can lower or raise the volume of her voice and/or the music.\\nMaya herself is a buff looking brunette, it would have been nice if one could personalize their trainer's looks, and I will bet that's not to far down the road!\\n\\nMaya also has a peaceful room where she will lead you in a nice yoga interlude. As you progress through the program Maya will help you adjust your goals and set new ones.\\n\\nShe will also set meal plans for you if desired.\\n\\nI have to admit Maya has amazed me, besides kicking my booty in our exercise sessions. And the price point of $35 is so reasonable. Others love it too and there is an online community at [...] devoted to discussions on this program.\\n\\nHighly recommended!\\n\\nUPDATE: I had a question about the program and was very pleased with the Yourself! Fitness representative Caroline's fast response and helpfulness. Double delight - a great program with super customer service!   \n",
